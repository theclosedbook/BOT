Alchemy is often associated with the quest to turn lead or other base metals into gold, though alchemists were also interested in many of the questions of modern chemistry.[8]\\n\\nThe modern word alchemy in turn is derived from the Arabic word al-kīmīā (الكیمیاء). This may have Egyptian origins since al-kīmīā is derived from the Ancient Greek χημία, which is in turn derived from the word Kemet, which is the ancient name of Egypt in the Egyptian language.[9] Alternately, al-kīmīā may derive from χημεία \\'cast together\\'.[10]\\nModern principles\\nLaboratory, Institute of Biochemistry, University of Cologne in Germany.\\n\\nThe current model of atomic structure is the quantum mechanical model.[11] Traditional chemistry starts with the study of elementary particles, atoms, molecules,[12] substances, metals, crystals and other aggregates of matter. Matter can be studied in solid, liquid, gas and plasma states, in isolation or in combination. The interactions[disambiguation needed], reactions and transformations that are studied in chemistry are usually the result of interactions between atoms, leading to rearrangements of the chemical bonds which hold atoms together. Such behaviors are studied in a chemistry laboratory.\\n\\nThe chemistry laboratory stereotypically uses various forms of laboratory glassware. However glassware is not central to chemistry, and a great deal of experimental (as well as applied/industrial) chemistry is done without it.\\nSolutions of substances in reagent bottles, including ammonium hydroxide and nitric acid, illuminated in different colors\\n\\nA chemical reaction is a transformation of some substances into one or more different substances.[13] The basis of such a chemical transformation is the rearrangement of electrons in the chemical bonds between atoms. It can be symbolically depicted through a chemical equation, which usually involves atoms as subjects. The number of atoms on the left and the right in the equation for a chemical transformation is equal. (When the number of atoms on either side is unequal, the transformation is referred to as a nuclear reaction or radioactive decay.) The type of chemical reactions a substance may undergo and the energy changes that may accompany it are constrained by certain basic rules, known as chemical laws.\\n\\nEnergy and entropy considerations are invariably important in almost all chemical studies. Chemical substances are classified in terms of their structure, phase, as well as their chemical compositions. They can be analyzed using the tools of chemical analysis, e.g. spectroscopy and chromatography. Scientists engaged in chemical research are known as chemists.[14] Most chemists specialize in one or more sub-disciplines. Several concepts are essential for the study of chemistry; some of them are:[15]\\nMatter\\nMain article: Matter\\n\\nIn chemistry, matter is defined as anything that has rest mass and volume (it takes up space) and is made up of particles. The particles that make up matter have rest mass as well – not all particles have rest mass, such as the photon. Matter can be a pure chemical substance or a mixture of substances.[16]\\nAtom\\nMain article: Atom\\nA diagram of an atom based on the Bohr model\\n\\nThe atom is the basic unit of chemistry. It consists of a dense core called the atomic nucleus surrounded by a space occupied by an electron cloud. The nucleus is made up of positively charged protons and uncharged neutrons (together called nucleons), while the electron cloud consists of negatively charged electrons which orbit the nucleus. In a neutral atom, the negatively charged electrons balance out the positive charge of the protons. The nucleus is dense; the mass of a nucleon is approximately 1,836 times that of an electron, yet the radius of an atom is about 10,000 times that of its nucleus.[17][18]\\n\\nThe atom is also the smallest entity that can be envisaged to retain the chemical properties of the element, such as electronegativity, ionization potential, preferred oxidation state(s), coordination number, and preferred types of bonds to form (e.g., metallic, ionic, covalent).\\nElement\\nStandard form of the periodic table of chemical elements. The colors represent different blocks of elements\\nMain article: Chemical element\\n\\nA chemical element is a pure substance which is composed of a single type of atom, characterized by its particular number of protons in the nuclei of its atoms, known as the atomic number and represented by the symbol Z. The mass number is the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in a nucleus. Although all the nuclei of all atoms belonging to one element will have the same atomic number, they may not necessarily have the same mass number; atoms of an element which have different mass numbers are known as isotopes. For example, all atoms with 6 protons in their nuclei are atoms of the chemical element carbon, but atoms of carbon may have mass numbers of 12 or 13.[18]\\n\\nThe standard presentation of the chemical elements is in the periodic table, which orders elements by atomic number. The periodic table is arranged in groups, or columns, and periods, or rows. The periodic table is useful in identifying periodic trends.[19]\\nCompound\\nCarbon dioxide (CO2), an example of a chemical compound\\nMain article: Chemical compound\\n\\nA compound is a pure chemical substance composed of more than one element. The properties of a compound bear little similarity to those of its elements.[20] The standard nomenclature of compounds is set by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). Organic compounds are named according to the organic nomenclature system.[21] The names for inorganic compounds are created according to the inorganic nomenclature system. When a compound has more than one component, then they are divided into two classes, the electropositive and the electronegative components.[22] In addition the Chemical Abstracts Service has devised a method to index chemical substances. In this scheme each chemical substance is identifiable by a number known as its CAS registry number.\\nMolecule\\nMain article: Molecule\\nA ball-and-stick representation of the caffeine molecule (C8H10N4O2).\\n\\nA molecule is the smallest indivisible portion of a pure chemical substance that has its unique set of chemical properties, that is, its potential to undergo a certain set of chemical reactions with other substances. However, this definition only works well for substances that are composed of molecules, which is not true of many substances (see below). Molecules are typically a set of atoms bound together by covalent bonds, such that the structure is electrically neutral and all valence electrons are paired with other electrons either in bonds or in lone pairs.\\n\\nThus, molecules exist as electrically neutral units, unlike ions. When this rule is broken, giving the \"molecule\" a charge, the result is sometimes named a molecular ion or a polyatomic ion. However, the discrete and separate nature of the molecular concept usually requires that molecular ions be present only in well-separated form, such as a directed beam in a vacuum in a mass spectrometer. Charged polyatomic collections residing in solids (for example, common sulfate or nitrate ions) are generally not considered \"molecules\" in chemistry. Some molecules contain one or more unpaired electrons, creating radicals. Most radicals are comparatively reactive, but some, such as nitric oxide (NO) can be stable.\\nA 2-D structural formula of a benzene molecule (C6H6)\\n\\nThe \"inert\" or noble gas elements (helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon and radon) are composed of lone atoms as their smallest discrete unit, but the other isolated chemical elements consist of either molecules or networks of atoms bonded to each other in some way. Identifiable molecules compose familiar substances such as water, air, and many organic compounds like alcohol, sugar, gasoline, and the various pharmaceuticals.\\n\\nHowever, not all substances or chemical compounds consist of discrete molecules, and indeed most of the solid substances that make up the solid crust, mantle, and core of the Earth are chemical compounds without molecules. These other types of substances, such as ionic compounds and network solids, are organized in such a way as to lack the existence of identifiable molecules per se. Instead, these substances are discussed in terms of formula units or unit cells as the smallest repeating structure within the substance. Examples of such substances are mineral salts (such as table salt), solids like carbon and diamond, metals, and familiar silica and silicate minerals such as quartz and granite.\\n\\nOne of the main characteristics of a molecule is its geometry often called its structure. While the structure of diatomic, triatomic or tetra-atomic molecules may be trivial, (linear, angular pyramidal etc.) the structure of polyatomic molecules, that are constituted of more than six atoms (of several elements) can be crucial for its chemical nature.\\nSubstance and mixture\\nCín.png Sulfur-sample.jpg\\nDiamants maclés 2(République d\\'Afrique du Sud).jpg Sugar 2xmacro.jpg\\nSal (close).jpg Sodium bicarbonate.jpg\\nExamples of pure chemical substances. From left to right: the elements tin (Sn) and sulfur (S), diamond (an allotrope of carbon), sucrose (pure sugar), and sodium chloride (salt) and sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), which are both ionic compounds.\\n\\nA chemical substance is a kind of matter with a definite composition and set of properties.[23] A collection of substances is called a mixture. Examples of mixtures are air and alloys.[24]\\nMole and amount of substance\\nMain article: Mole\\n\\nThe mole is a unit of measurement that denotes an amount of substance (also called chemical amount). One mole is defined to contain exactly 6.02214076×1023 particles (atoms, molecules, ions, or electrons), where the number of particles per mole is known as the Avogadro constant.[25] Molar concentration is the amount of a particular substance per volume of solution, and is commonly reported in mol/dm3.[26]\\nPhase\\nDiagram showing relationships among the phases and the terms used to describe phase changes.\\nMain article: Phase\\n\\nIn addition to the specific chemical properties that distinguish different chemical classifications, chemicals can exist in several phases. For the most part, the chemical classifications are independent of these bulk phase classifications; however, some more exotic phases are incompatible with certain chemical properties. A phase is a set of states of a chemical system that have similar bulk structural properties, over a range of conditions, such as pressure or temperature.\\n\\nPhysical properties, such as density and refractive index tend to fall within values characteristic of the phase. The phase of matter is defined by the phase transition, which is when energy put into or taken out of the system goes into rearranging the structure of the system, instead of changing the bulk conditions.\\n\\nSometimes the distinction between phases can be continuous instead of having a discrete boundary\\' in this case the matter is considered to be in a supercritical state. When three states meet based on the conditions, it is known as a triple point and since this is invariant, it is a convenient way to define a set of conditions.\\n\\nThe most familiar examples of phases are solids, liquids, and gases. Many substances exhibit multiple solid phases. For example, there are three phases of solid iron (alpha, gamma, and delta) that vary based on temperature and pressure. A principal difference between solid phases is the crystal structure, or arrangement, of the atoms. Another phase commonly encountered in the study of chemistry is the aqueous phase, which is the state of substances dissolved in aqueous solution (that is, in water).\\n\\nLess familiar phases include plasmas, Bose–Einstein condensates and fermionic condensates and the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases of magnetic materials. While most familiar phases deal with three-dimensional systems, it is also possible to define analogs in two-dimensional systems, which has received attention for its relevance to systems in biology.\\nBonding\\nMain article: Chemical bond\\nAn animation of the process of ionic bonding between sodium (Na) and chlorine (Cl) to form sodium chloride, or common table salt. Ionic bonding involves one atom taking valence electrons from another (as opposed to sharing, which occurs in covalent bonding)\\n\\nAtoms sticking together in molecules or crystals are said to be bonded with one another. A chemical bond may be visualized as the multipole balance between the positive charges in the nuclei and the negative charges oscillating about them.[27] More than simple attraction and repulsion, the energies and distributions characterize the availability of an electron to bond to another atom.\\n\\nThe chemical bond can be a covalent bond, an ionic bond, a hydrogen bond or just because of Van der Waals force. Each of these kinds of bonds is ascribed to some potential. These potentials create the interactions[disambiguation needed] which hold atoms together in molecules or crystals. In many simple compounds, valence bond theory, the Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion model (VSEPR), and the concept of oxidation number can be used to explain molecular structure and composition.\\n\\nAn ionic bond is formed when a metal loses one or more of its electrons, becoming a positively charged cation, and the electrons are then gained by the non-metal atom, becoming a negatively charged anion. The two oppositely charged ions attract one another, and the ionic bond is the electrostatic force of attraction between them. For example, sodium (Na), a metal, loses one electron to become an Na+ cation while chlorine (Cl), a non-metal, gains this electron to become Cl−. The ions are held together due to electrostatic attraction, and that compound sodium chloride (NaCl), or common table salt, is formed.\\nIn the methane molecule (CH4), the carbon atom shares a pair of valence electrons with each of the four hydrogen atoms. Thus, the octet rule is satisfied for C-atom (it has eight electrons in its valence shell) and the duet rule is satisfied for the H-atoms (they have two electrons in their valence shells).\\n\\nIn a covalent bond, one or more pairs of valence electrons are shared by two atoms: the resulting electrically neutral group of bonded atoms is termed a molecule. Atoms will share valence electrons in such a way as to create a noble gas electron configuration (eight electrons in their outermost shell) for each atom. Atoms that tend to combine in such a way that they each have eight electrons in their valence shell are said to follow the octet rule. However, some elements like hydrogen and lithium need only two electrons in their outermost shell to attain this stable configuration; these atoms are said to follow the duet rule, and in this way they are reaching the electron configuration of the noble gas helium, which has two electrons in its outer shell.\\n\\nSimilarly, theories from classical physics can be used to predict many ionic structures. With more complicated compounds, such as metal complexes, valence bond theory is less applicable and alternative approaches, such as the molecular orbital theory, are generally used. See diagram on electronic orbitals.\\nEnergy\\nMain article: Energy\\n\\nIn the context of chemistry, energy is an attribute of a substance as a consequence of its atomic, molecular or aggregate structure. Since a chemical transformation is accompanied by a change in one or more of these kinds of structures, it is invariably accompanied by an increase or decrease of energy of the substances involved. Some energy is transferred between the surroundings and the reactants of the reaction in the form of heat or light; thus the products of a reaction may have more or less energy than the reactants.\\n\\nA reaction is said to be exergonic if the final state is lower on the energy scale than the initial state; in the case of endergonic reactions the situation is the reverse. A reaction is said to be exothermic if the reaction releases heat to the surroundings; in the case of endothermic reactions, the reaction absorbs heat from the surroundings.\\n\\nChemical reactions are invariably not possible unless the reactants surmount an energy barrier known as the activation energy. The speed of a chemical reaction (at given temperature T) is related to the activation energy E, by the Boltzmann\\'s population factor e − E / k T e^{-E/kT} – that is the probability of a molecule to have energy greater than or equal to E at the given temperature T. This exponential dependence of a reaction rate on temperature is known as the Arrhenius equation. The activation energy necessary for a chemical reaction to occur can be in the form of heat, light, electricity or mechanical force in the form of ultrasound.[28]\\n\\nA related concept free energy, which also incorporates entropy considerations, is a very useful means for predicting the feasibility of a reaction and determining the state of equilibrium of a chemical reaction, in chemical thermodynamics. A reaction is feasible only if the total change in the Gibbs free energy is negative, Δ G ≤ 0 \\\\Delta G \\\\le 0 \\\\,; if it is equal to zero the chemical reaction is said to be at equilibrium.\\n\\nThere exist only limited possible states of energy for electrons, atoms and molecules. These are determined by the rules of quantum mechanics, which require quantization of energy of a bound system. The atoms/molecules in a higher energy state are said to be excited. The molecules/atoms of substance in an excited energy state are often much more reactive; that is, more amenable to chemical reactions.\\n\\nThe phase of a substance is invariably determined by its energy and the energy of its surroundings. When the intermolecular forces of a substance are such that the energy of the surroundings is not sufficient to overcome them, it occurs in a more ordered phase like liquid or solid as is the case with water (H2O); a liquid at room temperature because its molecules are bound by hydrogen bonds.[29] Whereas hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a gas at room temperature and standard pressure, as its molecules are bound by weaker dipole-dipole interactions.\\n\\nThe transfer of energy from one chemical substance to another depends on the size of energy quanta emitted from one substance. However, heat energy is often transferred more easily from almost any substance to another because the phonons responsible for vibrational and rotational energy levels in a substance have much less energy than photons invoked for the electronic energy transfer. Thus, because vibrational and rotational energy levels are more closely spaced than electronic energy levels, heat is more easily transferred between substances relative to light or other forms of electronic energy. For example, ultraviolet electromagnetic radiation is not transferred with as much efficacy from one substance to another as thermal or electrical energy.\\n\\nThe existence of characteristic energy levels for different chemical substances is useful for their identification by the analysis of spectral lines. Different kinds of spectra are often used in chemical spectroscopy, e.g. IR, microwave, NMR, ESR, etc. Spectroscopy is also used to identify the composition of remote objects – like stars and distant galaxies – by analyzing their radiation spectra.\\nEmission spectrum of iron\\n\\nThe term chemical energy is often used to indicate the potential of a chemical substance to undergo a transformation through a chemical reaction or to transform other chemical substances.\\nReaction\\nMain article: Chemical reaction\\nDuring chemical reactions, bonds between atoms break and form, resulting in different substances with different properties. In a blast furnace, iron oxide, a compound, reacts with carbon monoxide to form iron, one of the chemical elements, and carbon dioxide.\\n\\nWhen a chemical substance is transformed as a result of its interaction with another substance or with energy, a chemical reaction is said to have occurred. A chemical reaction is therefore a concept related to the \"reaction\" of a substance when it comes in close contact with another, whether as a mixture or a solution; exposure to some form of energy, or both. It results in some energy exchange between the constituents of the reaction as well as with the system environment, which may be designed vessels—often laboratory glassware.\\n\\nChemical reactions can result in the formation or dissociation of molecules, that is, molecules breaking apart to form two or more molecules or rearrangement of atoms within or across molecules. Chemical reactions usually involve the making or breaking of chemical bonds. Oxidation, reduction, dissociation, acid–base neutralization and molecular rearrangement are some examples of common chemical reactions.\\n\\nA chemical reaction can be symbolically depicted through a chemical equation. While in a non-nuclear chemical reaction the number and kind of atoms on both sides of the equation are equal, for a nuclear reaction this holds true only for the nuclear particles viz. protons and neutrons.[30]\\n\\nThe sequence of steps in which the reorganization of chemical bonds may be taking place in the course of a chemical reaction is called its mechanism. A chemical reaction can be envisioned to take place in a number of steps, each of which may have a different speed. Many reaction intermediates with variable stability can thus be envisaged during the course of a reaction. Reaction mechanisms are proposed to explain the kinetics and the relative product mix of a reaction. Many physical chemists specialize in exploring and proposing the mechanisms of various chemical reactions. Several empirical rules, like the Woodward–Hoffmann rules often come in handy while proposing a mechanism for a chemical reaction.\\n\\nAccording to the IUPAC gold book, a chemical reaction is \"a process that results in the interconversion of chemical species.\"[31] Accordingly, a chemical reaction may be an elementary reaction or a stepwise reaction. An additional caveat is made, in that this definition includes cases where the interconversion of conformers is experimentally observable. Such detectable chemical reactions normally involve sets of molecular entities as indicated by this definition, but it is often conceptually convenient to use the term also for changes involving single molecular entities (i.e. \\'microscopic chemical events\\').\\nIons and salts\\nThe crystal lattice structure of potassium chloride (KCl), a salt which is formed due to the attraction of K+ cations and Cl− anions. Note how the overall charge of the ionic compound is zero.\\nMain article: Ion\\n\\nAn ion is a charged species, an atom or a molecule, that has lost or gained one or more electrons. When an atom loses an electron and thus has more protons than electrons, the atom is a positively charged ion or cation. When an atom gains an electron and thus has more electrons than protons, the atom is a negatively charged ion or anion. Cations and anions can form a crystalline lattice of neutral salts, such as the Na+ and Cl− ions forming sodium chloride, or NaCl. Examples of polyatomic ions that do not split up during acid–base reactions are hydroxide (OH−) and phosphate (PO43−).\\n\\nPlasma is composed of gaseous matter that has been completely ionized, usually through high temperature.\\nAcidity and basicity\\nHydrogen bromide exists in the gas phase as a diatomic molecule\\nMain article: Acid–base reaction\\n\\nA substance can often be classified as an acid or a base. There are several different theories which explain acid–base behavior. The simplest is Arrhenius theory, which states that acid is a substance that produces hydronium ions when it is dissolved in water, and a base is one that produces hydroxide ions when dissolved in water. According to Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory, acids are substances that donate a positive hydrogen ion to another substance in a chemical reaction; by extension, a base is the substance which receives that hydrogen ion.\\n\\nA third common theory is Lewis acid–base theory, which is based on the formation of new chemical bonds. Lewis theory explains that an acid is a substance which is capable of accepting a pair of electrons from another substance during the process of bond formation, while a base is a substance which can provide a pair of electrons to form a new bond. There are several other ways in which a substance may be classified as an acid or a base, as is evident in the history of this concept.[32]\\n\\nAcid strength is commonly measured by two methods. One measurement, based on the Arrhenius definition of acidity, is pH, which is a measurement of the hydronium ion concentration in a solution, as expressed on a negative logarithmic scale. Thus, solutions that have a low pH have a high hydronium ion concentration and can be said to be more acidic. The other measurement, based on the Brønsted–Lowry definition, is the acid dissociation constant (Ka), which measures the relative ability of a substance to act as an acid under the Brønsted–Lowry definition of an acid. That is, substances with a higher Ka are more likely to donate hydrogen ions in chemical reactions than those with lower Ka values.\\nRedox\\nMain article: Redox\\n\\nRedox (reduction-oxidation) reactions include all chemical reactions in which atoms have their oxidation state changed by either gaining electrons (reduction) or losing electrons (oxidation). Substances that have the ability to oxidize other substances are said to be oxidative and are known as oxidizing agents, oxidants or oxidizers. An oxidant removes electrons from another substance. Similarly, substances that have the ability to reduce other substances are said to be reductive and are known as reducing agents, reductants, or reducers.\\n\\nA reductant transfers electrons to another substance and is thus oxidized itself. And because it \"donates\" electrons it is also called an electron donor. Oxidation and reduction properly refer to a change in oxidation number—the actual transfer of electrons may never occur. Thus, oxidation is better defined as an increase in oxidation number, and reduction as a decrease in oxidation number.\\nEquilibrium\\nMain article: Chemical equilibrium\\n\\nAlthough the concept of equilibrium is widely used across sciences, in the context of chemistry, it arises whenever a number of different states of the chemical composition are possible, as for example, in a mixture of several chemical compounds that can react with one another, or when a substance can be present in more than one kind of phase.\\n\\nA system of chemical substances at equilibrium, even though having an unchanging composition, is most often not static; molecules of the substances continue to react with one another thus giving rise to a dynamic equilibrium. Thus the concept describes the state in which the parameters such as chemical composition remain unchanged over time.\\nChemical laws\\nMain article: Chemical law\\n\\nChemical reactions are governed by certain laws, which have become fundamental concepts in chemistry.

Since several millennia BC, civilizations were using technologies that would eventually form the basis of the various branches of chemistry. Examples include extracting metals from ores, making pottery and glazes, fermenting beer and wine, extracting chemicals from plants for medicine and perfume, rendering fat into soap, making glass, and making alloys like bronze.\\n\\nChemistry was preceded by its protoscience, alchemy, which operated a non-scientific approach to understanding the constituents of matter and their interactions. Despite being unsuccessful in explaining the nature of matter and its transformations, alchemists set the stage for modern chemistry by performing experiments and recording the results. Robert Boyle, although skeptical of elements and convinced of alchemy, played a key part in elevating the \"sacred art\" as an independent, fundamental and philosophical discipline in his work The Sceptical Chymist (1661).[33]\\n\\nWhile both alchemy and chemistry are concerned with matter and its transformations, the crucial difference was given by the scientific method that chemists employed in their work. Chemistry, as a body of knowledge distinct from alchemy, became an established science with the work of Antoine Lavoisier, who developed a law of conservation of mass that demanded careful measurement and quantitative observations of chemical phenomena. The history of chemistry afterwards is intertwined with the history of thermodynamics, especially through the work of Willard Gibbs.[34]\\nDefinition\\n\\nThe definition of chemistry has changed over time, as new discoveries and theories add to the functionality of the science. The term \"chymistry\", in the view of noted scientist Robert Boyle in 1661, meant the subject of the material principles of mixed bodies.[35] In 1663, the chemist Christopher Glaser described \"chymistry\" as a scientific art, by which one learns to dissolve bodies, and draw from them the different substances on their composition, and how to unite them again, and exalt them to a higher perfection.[36]\\n\\nThe 1730 definition of the word \"chemistry\", as used by Georg Ernst Stahl, meant the art of resolving mixed, compound, or aggregate bodies into their principles; and of composing such bodies from those principles.[37] In 1837, Jean-Baptiste Dumas considered the word \"chemistry\" to refer to the science concerned with the laws and effects of molecular forces.[38] This definition further evolved until, in 1947, it came to mean the science of substances: their structure, their properties, and the reactions that change them into other substances – a characterization accepted by Linus Pauling.[39] More recently, in 1998, Professor Raymond Chang broadened the definition of \"chemistry\" to mean the study of matter and the changes it undergoes.[40]\\nBackground\\nMain article: History of chemistry\\nSee also: Alchemy and Timeline of chemistry\\nDemocritus\\' atomist philosophy was later adopted by Epicurus (341–270 BCE).\\n\\nEarly civilizations, such as the Egyptians[41] Babylonians and Indians[42] amassed practical knowledge concerning the arts of metallurgy, pottery and dyes, but didn\\'t develop a systematic theory.\\n\\nA basic chemical hypothesis first emerged in Classical Greece with the theory of four elements as propounded definitively by Aristotle stating that fire, air, earth and water were the fundamental elements from which everything is formed as a combination. Greek atomism dates back to 440 BC, arising in works by philosophers such as Democritus and Epicurus. In 50 BCE, the Roman philosopher Lucretius expanded upon the theory in his book De rerum natura (On The Nature of Things).[43][44] Unlike modern concepts of science, Greek atomism was purely philosophical in nature, with little concern for empirical observations and no concern for chemical experiments.[45]\\n\\nAn early form of the idea of conservation of mass is the notion that \"Nothing comes from nothing\" in Ancient Greek philosophy, which can be found in Empedocles (approx. 4th century BC): \"For it is impossible for anything to come to be from what is not, and it cannot be brought about or heard of that what is should be utterly destroyed.\"[46] and Epicurus (3rd century BC), who, describing the nature of the Universe, wrote that \"the totality of things was always such as it is now, and always will be\".[47]\\n15th-century artistic impression of Jābir ibn Hayyān (Geber), a Perso-Arab alchemist and pioneer in organic chemistry.\\n\\nIn the Hellenistic world the art of alchemy first proliferated, mingling magic and occultism into the study of natural substances with the ultimate goal of transmuting elements into gold and discovering the elixir of eternal life.[48] Work, particularly the development of distillation, continued in the early Byzantine period with the most famous practitioner being the 4th century Greek-Egyptian Zosimos of Panopolis.[49] Alchemy continued to be developed and practised throughout the Arab world after the Muslim conquests,[50] and from there, and from the Byzantine remnants,[51] diffused into medieval and Renaissance Europe through Latin translations.\\n\\nThe Arabic works attributed to Jabir ibn Hayyan introduced a systematic classification of chemical substances, and provided instructions for deriving an inorganic compound (sal ammoniac or ammonium chloride) from organic substances (such as plants, blood, and hair) by chemical means.[52] Some Arabic Jabirian works (e.g., the \"Book of Mercy\", and the \"Book of Seventy\") were later translated into Latin under the Latinized name \"Geber\",[53] and in 13th-century Europe an anonymous writer, usually referred to as pseudo-Geber, started to produce alchemical and metallurgical writings under this name.[54] Later influential Muslim philosophers, such as Abū al-Rayhān al-Bīrūnī[55] and Avicenna[56] disputed the theories of alchemy, particularly the theory of the transmutation of metals.\\n\\nUnder the influence of the new empirical methods propounded by Sir Francis Bacon and others, a group of chemists at Oxford, Robert Boyle, Robert Hooke and John Mayow began to reshape the old alchemical traditions into a scientific discipline. Boyle in particular questioned some commonly held chemical theories and argued for chemical practitioners to be more \"philosophical\" and less commercially focused in The Sceptical Chemyst.[33] He formulated Boyle\\'s law, rejected the classical \"four elements\" and proposed a mechanistic alternative of atoms and chemical reactions that could be subject to rigorous experiment.[57]\\nAntoine-Laurent de Lavoisier is considered the \"Father of Modern Chemistry\".[58]\\n\\nIn the following decades, many important discoveries were made, such as the nature of \\'air\\' which was discovered to be composed of many different gases. The Scottish chemist Joseph Black and the Flemish Jan Baptist van Helmont discovered carbon dioxide, or what Black called \\'fixed air\\' in 1754; Henry Cavendish discovered hydrogen and elucidated its properties and Joseph Priestley and, independently, Carl Wilhelm Scheele isolated pure oxygen. The theory of phlogiston (a substance at the root of all combustion) was propounded by the German Georg Ernst Stahl in the early 18th century and was only overturned by the end of the century by the French chemist Antoine Lavoisier, the chemical analogue of Newton in physics. Lavoisier did more than any other to establish the new science on proper theoretical footing, by elucidating the principle of conservation of mass and developing a new system of chemical nomenclature used to this day.[59]\\n\\nEnglish scientist John Dalton proposed the modern theory of atoms; that all substances are composed of indivisible \\'atoms\\' of matter and that different atoms have varying atomic weights.\\n\\nThe development of the electrochemical theory of chemical combinations occurred in the early 19th century as the result of the work of two scientists in particular, Jöns Jacob Berzelius and Humphry Davy, made possible by the prior invention of the voltaic pile by Alessandro Volta. Davy discovered nine new elements including the alkali metals by extracting them from their oxides with electric current.[60]\\nIn his periodic table, Dmitri Mendeleev predicted the existence of 7 new elements,[61] and placed all 60 elements known at the time in their correct places.[62]\\n\\nBritish William Prout first proposed ordering all the elements by their atomic weight as all atoms had a weight that was an exact multiple of the atomic weight of hydrogen. J.A.R. Newlands devised an early table of elements, which was then developed into the modern periodic table of elements[63] in the 1860s by Dmitri Mendeleev and independently by several other scientists including Julius Lothar Meyer.[64][65] The inert gases, later called the noble gases were discovered by William Ramsay in collaboration with Lord Rayleigh at the end of the century, thereby filling in the basic structure of the table.\\nTop: Expected results: alpha particles passing through the plum pudding model of the atom undisturbed.\\nBottom: Observed results: a small portion of the particles were deflected, indicating a small, concentrated charge.\\n\\nAt the turn of the twentieth century the theoretical underpinnings of chemistry were finally understood due to a series of remarkable discoveries that succeeded in probing and discovering the very nature of the internal structure of atoms. In 1897, J.J. Thomson of the University of Cambridge discovered the electron and soon after the French scientist Becquerel as well as the couple Pierre and Marie Curie investigated the phenomenon of radioactivity. In a series of pioneering scattering experiments Ernest Rutherford at the University of Manchester discovered the internal structure of the atom and the existence of the proton, classified and explained the different types of radioactivity and successfully transmuted the first element by bombarding nitrogen with alpha particles.\\n\\nHis work on atomic structure was improved on by his students, the Danish physicist Niels Bohr, the Englishman Henry Moseley and the German Otto Hahn, who went on to father the emerging nuclear chemistry and discovered nuclear fission. The electronic theory of chemical bonds and molecular orbitals was developed by the American scientists Linus Pauling and Gilbert N. Lewis.\\n\\nThe year 2011 was declared by the United Nations as the International Year of Chemistry.[66] It was an initiative of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, and of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization and involves chemical societies, academics, and institutions worldwide and relied on individual initiatives to organize local and regional activities.\\n\\nOrganic chemistry was developed by Justus von Liebig and others, following Friedrich Wöhler\\'s synthesis of urea.[67] Other crucial 19th century advances were; an understanding of valence bonding (Edward Frankland in 1852) and the application of thermodynamics to chemistry (J. W. Gibbs and Svante Arrhenius in the 1870s).\\nPractice\\nSubdisciplines\\nSee also: Outline of chemistry § Branches of chemistry\\nQuestion book-new.svg\\n\\t\\nThis article relies largely or entirely on a single source.

There are also several main cross-disciplinary and more specialized fields of chemistry.[68]\\n\\n    Analytical chemistry is the analysis of material samples to gain an understanding of their chemical composition and structure. Analytical chemistry incorporates standardized experimental methods in chemistry. These methods may be used in all subdisciplines of chemistry, excluding purely theoretical chemistry.\\n    Biochemistry is the study of the chemicals, chemical reactions and interaction[disambiguation needed]s that take place in living organisms. Biochemistry and organic chemistry are closely related, as in medicinal chemistry or neurochemistry. Biochemistry is also associated with molecular biology and genetics.\\n    Inorganic chemistry is the study of the properties and reactions of inorganic compounds. The distinction between organic and inorganic disciplines is not absolute and there is much overlap, most importantly in the sub-discipline of organometallic chemistry.\\n    Materials chemistry is the preparation, characterization, and understanding of substances with a useful function. The field is a new breadth of study in graduate programs, and it integrates elements from all classical areas of chemistry with a focus on fundamental issues that are unique to materials. Primary systems of study include the chemistry of condensed phases (solids, liquids, polymers) and interfaces between different phases.\\n    Neurochemistry is the study of neurochemicals; including transmitters, peptides, proteins, lipids, sugars, and nucleic acids; their interactions, and the roles they play in forming, maintaining, and modifying the nervous system.\\n    Nuclear chemistry is the study of how subatomic particles come together and make nuclei. Modern Transmutation is a large component of nuclear chemistry, and the table of nuclides is an important result and tool for this field.\\n    Organic chemistry is the study of the structure, properties, composition, mechanisms, and reactions of organic compounds. An organic compound is defined as any compound based on a carbon skeleton.\\n    Physical chemistry is the study of the physical and fundamental basis of chemical systems and processes. In particular, the energetics and dynamics of such systems and processes are of interest to physical chemists. Important areas of study include chemical thermodynamics, chemical kinetics, electrochemistry, statistical mechanics, spectroscopy, and more recently, astrochemistry.[69] Physical chemistry has large overlap with molecular physics. Physical chemistry involves the use of infinitesimal calculus in deriving equations. It is usually associated with quantum chemistry and theoretical chemistry. Physical chemistry is a distinct discipline from chemical physics, but again, there is very strong overlap.\\n    Theoretical chemistry is the study of chemistry via fundamental theoretical reasoning (usually within mathematics or physics). In particular the application of quantum mechanics to chemistry is called quantum chemistry. Since the end of the Second World War, the development of computers has allowed a systematic development of computational chemistry, which is the art of developing and applying computer programs for solving chemical problems. Theoretical chemistry has large overlap with (theoretical and experimental) condensed matter physics and molecular physics.\\n\\nOthers subdivisions include electrochemistry, femtochemistry, flavor chemistry, flow chemistry, immunohistochemistry, hydrogenation chemistry, mathematical chemistry, molecular mechanics, natural product chemistry, organometallic chemistry, petrochemistry, photochemistry, physical organic chemistry, polymer chemistry, radiochemistry, sonochemistry, supramolecular chemistry, synthetic chemistry, and many others.\\nInterdisciplinary\\n\\nInterdisciplinary fields include agrochemistry, astrochemistry (and cosmochemistry), atmospheric chemistry, chemical engineering, chemical biology, chemo-informatics, environmental chemistry, geochemistry, green chemistry, immunochemistry, marine chemistry, materials science, mechanochemistry, medicinal chemistry, molecular biology, nanotechnology, oenology, pharmacology, phytochemistry, solid-state chemistry, surface science, thermochemistry, and many others.\\nIndustry\\nMain article: Chemical industry\\n\\nThe chemical industry represents an important economic activity worldwide.

New ideas in physics often explain the fundamental mechanisms studied by other sciences[3] and suggest new avenues of research in these and other academic disciplines such as mathematics and philosophy.\\n\\nAdvances in physics often enable advances in new technologies. For example, advances in the understanding of electromagnetism, solid-state physics, and nuclear physics led directly to the development of new products that have dramatically transformed modern-day society, such as television, computers, domestic appliances, and nuclear weapons;[3] advances in thermodynamics led to the development of industrialization; and advances in mechanics inspired the development of calculus.\\nHistory\\nMain article: History of physics\\n\\nThe word \"physics\" comes from Ancient Greek: φυσική (ἐπιστήμη), romanized: physikḗ (epistḗmē), meaning \"knowledge of nature\".[8][9][10]\\nAncient astronomy\\nMain article: History of astronomy\\nAncient Egyptian astronomy is evident in monuments like the ceiling of Senemut\\'s tomb from the Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt.\\n\\nAstronomy is one of the oldest natural sciences. Early civilizations dating back before 3000 BCE, such as the Sumerians, ancient Egyptians, and the Indus Valley Civilisation, had a predictive knowledge and a basic awareness of the motions of the Sun, Moon, and stars. The stars and planets, believed to represent gods, were often worshipped. While the explanations for the observed positions of the stars were often unscientific and lacking in evidence, these early observations laid the foundation for later astronomy, as the stars were found to traverse great circles across the sky,[6] which could not explain the positions of the planets.\\n\\nAccording to Asger Aaboe, the origins of Western astronomy can be found in Mesopotamia, and all Western efforts in the exact sciences are descended from late Babylonian astronomy.[11] Egyptian astronomers left monuments showing knowledge of the constellations and the motions of the celestial bodies,[12] while Greek poet Homer wrote of various celestial objects in his Iliad and Odyssey; later Greek astronomers provided names, which are still used today, for most constellations visible from the Northern Hemisphere.[13]\\nNatural philosophy\\nMain article: Natural philosophy\\n\\nNatural philosophy has its origins in Greece during the Archaic period (650 BCE – 480 BCE), when pre-Socratic philosophers like Thales rejected non-naturalistic explanations for natural phenomena and proclaimed that every event had a natural cause.[14] They proposed ideas verified by reason and observation, and many of their hypotheses proved successful in experiment;[15] for example, atomism was found to be correct approximately 2000 years after it was proposed by Leucippus and his pupil Democritus.[16]\\nMedieval European and Islamic\\nMain articles: European science in the Middle Ages and Physics in the medieval Islamic world\\n\\nThe Western Roman Empire fell in the fifth century, and this resulted in a decline in intellectual pursuits in the western part of Europe. By contrast, the Eastern Roman Empire (also known as the Byzantine Empire) resisted the attacks from the barbarians, and continued to advance various fields of learning, including physics.[17]\\n\\nIn the sixth century, Isidore of Miletus created an important compilation of Archimedes\\' works that are copied in the Archimedes Palimpsest.\\nIbn Al-Haytham (Alhazen) drawing\\nIbn al-Haytham (c. 965–c. 1040), Book of Optics Book I, [6.85], [6.86]. Book II, [3.80] describes his camera obscura experiments.[18]\\n\\nIn sixth-century Europe John Philoponus, a Byzantine scholar, questioned Aristotle\\'s teaching of physics and noted its flaws. He introduced the theory of impetus. Aristotle\\'s physics was not scrutinized until Philoponus appeared; unlike Aristotle, who based his physics on verbal argument, Philoponus relied on observation. On Aristotle\\'s physics Philoponus wrote:\\n\\n    But this is completely erroneous, and our view may be corroborated by actual observation more effectively than by any sort of verbal argument. For if you let fall from the same height two weights of which one is many times as heavy as the other, you will see that the ratio of the times required for the motion does not depend on the ratio of the weights, but that the difference in time is a very small one. And so, if the difference in the weights is not considerable, that is, of one is, let us say, double the other, there will be no difference, or else an imperceptible difference, in time, though the difference in weight is by no means negligible, with one body weighing twice as much as the other[19]\\n\\nPhiloponus\\' criticism of Aristotelian principles of physics served as an inspiration for Galileo Galilei ten centuries later,[20] during the Scientific Revolution. Galileo cited Philoponus substantially in his works when arguing that Aristotelian physics was flawed.[21][22] In the 1300s Jean Buridan, a teacher in the faculty of arts at the University of Paris, developed the concept of impetus. It was a step toward the modern ideas of inertia and momentum.[23]\\n\\nIslamic scholarship inherited Aristotelian physics from the Greeks and during the Islamic Golden Age developed it further, especially placing emphasis on observation and a priori reasoning, developing early forms of the scientific method.\\n\\nAlthough Aristotle’s principles of physics was criticized, it is important to identify his the evidence he based his views off of.  When thinking of the history of science and math, it is notable to acknowledge the contributions made by older scientists. Aristotle’s science was the backbone of the science we learn in schools today. Aristotle published many biological works including The Parts of Animals, in which he discusses both biological science and natural science as well. It is also integral to mention the role Aristotle had in the progression of physics and metaphysics and how his beliefs and findings are still being taught in science classes to this day. The explanations that Aristotle gives for his findings are also very simple. When thinking of the elements, Aristotle believed that each element (earth, fire, water, air) had its own natural place. Meaning that because of the density of these elements, they will revert back to their own specific place in the atmosphere.[24] So, because of their weights, fire would be at the very top, air right underneath fire, then water, then lastly earth. He also stated that when a small amount of one element enters the natural place of another, the less abundant element will automatically go into its own natural place. For example, if there is a fire on the ground, if you pay attention, the flames go straight up into the air as an attempt to go back into its natural place where it belongs. Aristotle called his metaphysics “first philosophy” and characterized it as the study of “being as being”.[25] Aristotle defined the paradigm of motion as a being or entity encompassing different areas in the same body. [25]Meaning that if a person is at a certain location (A) they can move to a new location (B) and still take up the same amount of space. This is involved with Aristotle’s belief that motion is a continuum. In terms of matter, Aristotle believed that the change in category (ex. place) and quality (ex. color) of an object is defined as “alteration”. But, a change in substance is a change in matter. This is also very close to our idea of matter today.\\n\\nHe also devised his own laws of motion that include 1) heavier objects will fall faster, the speed being proportional to the weight and 2) the speed of the object that is falling depends inversely on the density object it is falling through (ex. density of air).[26] He also stated that, when it comes to violent motion (motion of an object when a force is applied to it by a second object) that the speed that object moves, will only be as fast or strong as the measure of force applied to it.[26] This is also seen in the rules of velocity and force that is taught in physics classes today. These rules are not necessarily what we see in our physics today but, they are very similar. It is evident that these rules were the backbone for other scientists to come revise and edit his beliefs.\\nThe basic way a pinhole camera works\\n\\nThe most notable innovations were in the field of optics and vision, which came from the works of many scientists like Ibn Sahl, Al-Kindi, Ibn al-Haytham, Al-Farisi and Avicenna. The most notable work was The Book of Optics (also known as Kitāb al-Manāẓir), written by Ibn al-Haytham, in which he conclusively disproved the ancient Greek idea about vision and came up with a new theory. In the book, he presented a study of the phenomenon of the camera obscura (his thousand-year-old version of the pinhole camera) and delved further into the way the eye itself works. Using dissections and the knowledge of previous scholars, he was able to begin to explain how light enters the eye. He asserted that the light ray is focused, but the actual explanation of how light projected to the back of the eye had to wait until 1604. His Treatise on Light explained the camera obscura, hundreds of years before the modern development of photography.[27]\\n\\nThe seven-volume Book of Optics (Kitab al-Manathir) hugely influenced thinking across disciplines from the theory of visual perception to the nature of perspective in medieval art, in both the East and the West, for more than 600 years. Many later European scholars and fellow polymaths, from Robert Grosseteste and Leonardo da Vinci to René Descartes, Johannes Kepler and Isaac Newton, were in his debt. Indeed, the influence of Ibn al-Haytham\\'s Optics ranks alongside that of Newton\\'s work of the same title, published 700 years later.\\n\\nThe translation of The Book of Optics had a huge impact on Europe. From it, later European scholars were able to build devices that replicated those Ibn al-Haytham had built and understand the way light works. From this, important inventions such as eyeglasses, magnifying glasses, telescopes, and cameras were developed.\\nClassical\\nMain article: Classical physics\\nGalileo Galilei (1564–1642) showed a modern appreciation for the proper relationship between mathematics, theoretical physics, and experimental physics.\\nSir Isaac Newton (1643–1727), whose laws of motion and universal gravitation were major milestones in classical physics\\n\\nPhysics became a separate science when early modern Europeans used experimental and quantitative methods to discover what are now considered to be the laws of physics.[28][page needed]\\n\\nMajor developments in this period include the replacement of the geocentric model of the Solar System with the heliocentric Copernican model, the laws governing the motion of planetary bodies (determined by Kepler between 1609 and 1619), Galileo\\'s pioneering work on telescopes and observational astronomy in the 16th and 17th Centuries, and Isaac Newton\\'s discovery and unification of the laws of motion and universal gravitation (that would come to bear his name).[29] Newton also developed calculus,[d] the mathematical study of continuous change, which provided new mathematical methods for solving physical problems.[30]\\n\\nThe discovery of new laws in thermodynamics, chemistry, and electromagnetics resulted from research efforts during the Industrial Revolution as energy needs increased.[31] The laws comprising classical physics remain very widely used for objects on everyday scales travelling at non-relativistic speeds, since they provide a very close approximation in such situations, and theories such as quantum mechanics and the theory of relativity simplify to their classical equivalents at such scales. Inaccuracies in classical mechanics for very small objects and very high velocities led to the development of modern physics in the 20th century.\\nModern\\nMain article: Modern physics\\nSee also: History of special relativity and History of quantum mechanics\\nMax Planck (1858–1947), the originator of the theory of quantum mechanics\\nAlbert Einstein (1879–1955), whose work on the photoelectric effect and the theory of relativity led to a revolution in 20th century physics\\n\\nModern physics began in the early 20th century with the work of Max Planck in quantum theory and Albert Einstein\\'s theory of relativity. Both of these theories came about due to inaccuracies in classical mechanics in certain situations. Classical mechanics predicted that the speed of light depends on the motion of the observer, which could not be resolved with the constant speed predicted by Maxwell\\'s equations of electromagnetism. This discrepancy was corrected by Einstein\\'s theory of special relativity, which replaced classical mechanics for fast-moving bodies and allowed for a constant speed of light.[32] Black-body radiation provided another problem for classical physics, which was corrected when Planck proposed that the excitation of material oscillators is possible only in discrete steps proportional to their frequency. This, along with the photoelectric effect and a complete theory predicting discrete energy levels of electron orbitals, led to the theory of quantum mechanics improving on classical physics at very small scales.[33]\\n\\nQuantum mechanics would come to be pioneered by Werner Heisenberg, Erwin Schrödinger and Paul Dirac.[33] From this early work, and work in related fields, the Standard Model of particle physics was derived.[34] Following the discovery of a particle with properties consistent with the Higgs boson at CERN in 2012,[35] all fundamental particles predicted by the standard model, and no others, appear to exist; however, physics beyond the Standard Model, with theories such as supersymmetry, is an active area of research.[36] Areas of mathematics in general are important to this field, such as the study of probabilities and groups.\\nPhilosophy\\nMain article: Philosophy of physics\\n\\nIn many ways, physics stems from ancient Greek philosophy. From Thales\\' first attempt to characterize matter, to Democritus\\' deduction that matter ought to reduce to an invariant state the Ptolemaic astronomy of a crystalline firmament, and Aristotle\\'s book Physics (an early book on physics, which attempted to analyze and define motion from a philosophical point of view), various Greek philosophers advanced their own theories of nature. Physics was known as natural philosophy until the late 18th century.[e]\\n\\nBy the 19th century, physics was realized as a discipline distinct from philosophy and the other sciences. Physics, as with the rest of science, relies on philosophy of science and its \"scientific method\" to advance our knowledge of the physical world.[38] The scientific method employs a priori reasoning as well as a posteriori reasoning and the use of Bayesian inference to measure the validity of a given theory.[39]\\n\\nThe development of physics has answered many questions of early philosophers but has also raised new questions. Study of the philosophical issues surrounding physics, the philosophy of physics, involves issues such as the nature of space and time, determinism, and metaphysical outlooks such as empiricism, naturalism and realism.[40]\\n\\nMany physicists have written about the philosophical implications of their work, for instance Laplace, who championed causal determinism,[41] and Erwin Schrödinger, who wrote on quantum mechanics.[42][43] The mathematical physicist Roger Penrose has been called a Platonist by Stephen Hawking,[44] a view Penrose discusses in his book, The Road to Reality.[45] Hawking referred to himself as an \"unashamed reductionist\" and took issue with Penrose\\'s views.[46]\\nCore theories\\nFurther information: Branches of physics and Outline of physics\\n\\nThough physics deals with a wide variety of systems, certain theories are used by all physicists. Each of these theories was experimentally tested numerous times and found to be an adequate approximation of nature. For instance, the theory of classical mechanics accurately describes the motion of objects, provided they are much larger than atoms and moving at a speed much less than the speed of light. These theories continue to be areas of active research today. Chaos theory, a remarkable aspect of classical mechanics, was discovered in the 20th century, three centuries after the original formulation of classical mechanics by Newton (1642–1727).\\n\\nThese central theories are important tools for research into more specialized topics, and any physicist, regardless of their specialization, is expected to be literate in them. These include classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, electromagnetism, and special relativity.\\nClassical\\nMain article: Classical physics\\n\\nClassical physics includes the traditional branches and topics that were recognized and well-developed before the beginning of the 20th century—classical mechanics, acoustics, optics, thermodynamics, and electromagnetism. Classical mechanics is concerned with bodies acted on by forces and bodies in motion and may be divided into statics (study of the forces on a body or bodies not subject to an acceleration), kinematics (study of motion without regard to its causes), and dynamics (study of motion and the forces that affect it); mechanics may also be divided into solid mechanics and fluid mechanics (known together as continuum mechanics), the latter include such branches as hydrostatics, hydrodynamics, aerodynamics, and pneumatics. Acoustics is the study of how sound is produced, controlled, transmitted and received.[47] Important modern branches of acoustics include ultrasonics, the study of sound waves of very high frequency beyond the range of human hearing; bioacoustics, the physics of animal calls and hearing,[48] and electroacoustics, the manipulation of audible sound waves using electronics.[49]\\n\\nOptics, the study of light, is concerned not only with visible light but also with infrared and ultraviolet radiation, which exhibit all of the phenomena of visible light except visibility, e.g., reflection, refraction, interference, diffraction, dispersion, and polarization of light. Heat is a form of energy, the internal energy possessed by the particles of which a substance is composed; thermodynamics deals with the relationships between heat and other forms of energy. Electricity and magnetism have been studied as a single branch of physics since the intimate connection between them was discovered in the early 19th century; an electric current gives rise to a magnetic field, and a changing magnetic field induces an electric current. Electrostatics deals with electric charges at rest, electrodynamics with moving charges, and magnetostatics with magnetic poles at rest.\\nModern\\nMain article: Modern physics\\nModern physics\\nH ^ | ψ n ( t ) ⟩ = i ℏ ∂ ∂ t | ψ n ( t ) ⟩ {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\hat {H}}|\\\\psi _{n}(t)\\\\rangle =i\\\\hbar {\\\\frac {\\\\partial }{\\\\partial t}}|\\\\psi _{n}(t)\\\\rangle }\\nG μ ν + Λ g μ ν = κ T μ ν {\\\\displaystyle G_{\\\\mu \\\\nu }+\\\\Lambda g_{\\\\mu \\\\nu }={\\\\kappa }T_{\\\\mu \\\\nu }}\\nSchrödinger and Einstein field equations\\nFounders\\nConcepts\\nBranches\\nScientists\\nCategories\\n\\n    vte\\n\\nClassical physics is generally concerned with matter and energy on the normal scale of observation, while much of modern physics is concerned with the behavior of matter and energy under extreme conditions or on a very large or very small scale. For example, atomic and nuclear physics study matter on the smallest scale at which chemical elements can be identified. The physics of elementary particles is on an even smaller scale since it is concerned with the most basic units of matter; this branch of physics is also known as high-energy physics because of the extremely high energies necessary to produce many types of particles in particle accelerators. On this scale, ordinary, commonsensical notions of space, time, matter, and energy are no longer valid.[50]\\n\\nThe two chief theories of modern physics present a different picture of the concepts of space, time, and matter from that presented by classical physics. Classical mechanics approximates nature as continuous, while quantum theory is concerned with the discrete nature of many phenomena at the atomic and subatomic level and with the complementary aspects of particles and waves in the description of such phenomena. The theory of relativity is concerned with the description of phenomena that take place in a frame of reference that is in motion with respect to an observer; the special theory of relativity is concerned with motion in the absence of gravitational fields and the general theory of relativity with motion and its connection with gravitation. Both quantum theory and the theory of relativity find applications in many areas of modern physics.[51]\\nFundamental concepts in modern physics\\n\\n    Causality\\n    Covariance\\n    Action\\n    Physical field\\n    Symmetry\\n    Physical interaction\\n    Statistical ensemble\\n    Quantum\\n    Wave\\n    Particle\\n\\nDifference\\nThe basic domains of physics\\n\\nWhile physics aims to discover universal laws, its theories lie in explicit domains of applicability.\\nSolvay Conference of 1927, with prominent physicists such as Albert Einstein, Werner Heisenberg, Max Planck, Hendrik Lorentz, Niels Bohr, Marie Curie, Erwin Schrödinger and Paul Dirac\\n\\nLoosely speaking, the laws of classical physics accurately describe systems whose important length scales are greater than the atomic scale and whose motions are much slower than the speed of light. Outside of this domain, observations do not match predictions provided by classical mechanics. Einstein contributed the framework of special relativity, which replaced notions of absolute time and space with spacetime and allowed an accurate description of systems whose components have speeds approaching the speed of light. Planck, Schrödinger, and others introduced quantum mechanics, a probabilistic notion of particles and interactions that allowed an accurate description of atomic and subatomic scales. Later, quantum field theory unified quantum mechanics and special relativity. General relativity allowed for a dynamical, curved spacetime, with which highly massive systems and the large-scale structure of the universe can be well-described. General relativity has not yet been unified with the other fundamental descriptions; several candidate theories of quantum gravity are being developed.\\nRelation to other fields\\nThis parabola-shaped lava flow illustrates the application of mathematics in physics—in this case, Galileo\\'s law of falling bodies.\\nMathematics and ontology are used in physics. Physics is used in chemistry and cosmology.\\nPrerequisites\\n\\nMathematics provides a compact and exact language used to describe the order in nature. This was noted and advocated by Pythagoras,[52] Plato,[53] Galileo,[54] and Newton.\\n\\nPhysics uses mathematics[55] to organise and formulate experimental results. From those results, precise or estimated solutions are obtained, or quantitative results, from which new predictions can be made and experimentally confirmed or negated. The results from physics experiments are numerical data, with their units of measure and estimates of the errors in the measurements. Technologies based on mathematics, like computation have made computational physics an active area of research.\\nThe distinction between mathematics and physics is clear-cut, but not always obvious, especially in mathematical physics.\\n\\nOntology is a prerequisite for physics, but not for mathematics. It means physics is ultimately concerned with descriptions of the real world, while mathematics is concerned with abstract patterns, even beyond the real world. Thus physics statements are synthetic, while mathematical statements are analytic. Mathematics contains hypotheses, while physics contains theories. Mathematics statements have to be only logically true, while predictions of physics statements must match observed and experimental data.\\n\\nThe distinction is clear-cut, but not always obvious. For example, mathematical physics is the application of mathematics in physics. Its methods are mathematical, but its subject is physical.[56] The problems in this field start with a \"mathematical model of a physical situation\" (system) and a \"mathematical description of a physical law\" that will be applied to that system. Every mathematical statement used for solving has a hard-to-find physical meaning. The final mathematical solution has an easier-to-find meaning, because it is what the solver is looking for.[clarification needed]\\n\\nPure physics is a branch of fundamental science (also called basic science). Physics is also called \"the fundamental science\" because all branches of natural science like chemistry, astronomy, geology, and biology are constrained by laws of physics.[57] Similarly, chemistry is often called the central science because of its role in linking the physical sciences. For example, chemistry studies properties, structures, and reactions of matter (chemistry\\'s focus on the molecular and atomic scale distinguishes it from physics). Structures are formed because particles exert electrical forces on each other, properties include physical characteristics of given substances, and reactions are bound by laws of physics, like conservation of energy, mass, and charge. Physics is applied in industries like engineering and medicine.\\nApplication and influence\\nMain article: Applied physics\\nClassical physics implemented in an acoustic engineering model of sound reflecting from an acoustic diffuser\\nArchimedes\\' screw, a simple machine for lifting\\nExperiment using a laser\\n\\nApplied physics is a general term for physics research, which is intended for a particular use. An applied physics curriculum usually contains a few classes in an applied discipline, like geology or electrical engineering. It usually differs from engineering in that an applied physicist may not be designing something in particular, but rather is using physics or conducting physics research with the aim of developing new technologies or solving a problem.\\n\\nThe approach is similar to that of applied mathematics. Applied physicists use physics in scientific research. For instance, people working on accelerator physics might seek to build better particle detectors for research in theoretical physics.\\n\\nPhysics is used heavily in engineering. For example, statics, a subfield of mechanics, is used in the building of bridges and other static structures. The understanding and use of acoustics results in sound control and better concert halls; similarly, the use of optics creates better optical devices. An understanding of physics makes for more realistic flight simulators, video games, and movies, and is often critical in forensic investigations.\\n\\nWith the standard consensus that the laws of physics are universal and do not change with time, physics can be used to study things that would ordinarily be mired in uncertainty. For example, in the study of the origin of the earth, one can reasonably model earth\\'s mass, temperature, and rate of rotation, as a function of time allowing one to extrapolate forward or backward in time and so predict future or prior events. It also allows for simulations in engineering that drastically speed up the development of a new technology.\\n\\nBut there is also considerable interdisciplinarity, so many other important fields are influenced by physics (e.g., the fields of econophysics and sociophysics).\\nResearch\\nScientific method\\n\\nPhysicists use the scientific method to test the validity of a physical theory. By using a methodical approach to compare the implications of a theory with the conclusions drawn from its related experiments and observations, physicists are better able to test the validity of a theory in a logical, unbiased, and repeatable way. To that end, experiments are performed and observations are made in order to determine the validity or invalidity of the theory.[58]\\n\\nA scientific law is a concise verbal or mathematical statement of a relation that expresses a fundamental principle of some theory, such as Newton\\'s law of universal gravitation.[59]\\nTheory and experiment\\nMain articles: Theoretical physics and Experimental physics\\nThe astronaut and Earth are both in free fall. (Pictured: Astronaut Bruce McCandless.)\\nLightning is an electric current.\\n\\nTheorists seek to develop mathematical models that both agree with existing experiments and successfully predict future experimental results, while experimentalists devise and perform experiments to test theoretical predictions and explore new phenomena. Although theory and experiment are developed separately, they strongly affect and depend upon each other. Progress in physics frequently comes about when experimental results defy explanation by existing theories, prompting intense focus on applicable modelling, and when new theories generate experimentally testable predictions, which inspire the development of new experiments (and often related equipment).[60]\\n\\nPhysicists who work at the interplay of theory and experiment are called phenomenologists, who study complex phenomena observed in experiment and work to relate them to a fundamental theory.[61]\\n\\nTheoretical physics has historically taken inspiration from philosophy; electromagnetism was unified this way.[f] Beyond the known universe, the field of theoretical physics also deals with hypothetical issues,[g] such as parallel universes, a multiverse, and higher dimensions. Theorists invoke these ideas in hopes of solving particular problems with existing theories; they then explore the consequences of these ideas and work toward making testable predictions.\\n\\nExperimental physics expands, and is expanded by, engineering and technology. Experimental physicists who are involved in basic research design and perform experiments with equipment such as particle accelerators and lasers, whereas those involved in applied research often work in industry, developing technologies such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and transistors. Feynman has noted that experimentalists may seek areas that have not been explored well by theorists.[62]\\nScope and aims\\nPhysics involves modeling the natural world with theory, usually quantitative. Here, the path of a particle is modeled with the mathematics of calculus to explain its behavior: the purview of the branch of physics known as mechanics.\\n\\nPhysics covers a wide range of phenomena, from elementary particles (such as quarks, neutrinos, and electrons) to the largest superclusters of galaxies. Included in these phenomena are the most basic objects composing all other things. Therefore, physics is sometimes called the \"fundamental science\".[57] Physics aims to describe the various phenomena that occur in nature in terms of simpler phenomena. Thus, physics aims to both connect the things observable to humans to root causes, and then connect these causes together.\\n\\nFor example, the ancient Chinese observed that certain rocks (lodestone and magnetite) were attracted to one another by an invisible force. This effect was later called magnetism, which was first rigorously studied in the 17th century. But even before the Chinese discovered magnetism, the ancient Greeks knew of other objects such as amber, that when rubbed with fur would cause a similar invisible attraction between the two.[63] This was also first studied rigorously in the 17th century and came to be called electricity. Thus, physics had come to understand two observations of nature in terms of some root cause (electricity and magnetism). However, further work in the 19th century revealed that these two forces were just two different aspects of one force—electromagnetism. This process of \"unifying\" forces continues today, and electromagnetism and the weak nuclear force are now considered to be two aspects of the electroweak interaction. Physics hopes to find an ultimate reason (theory of everything) for why nature is as it is (see section Current research below for more information).[64]\\nResearch fields\\n\\nContemporary research in physics can be broadly divided into nuclear and particle physics; condensed matter physics; atomic, molecular, and optical physics; astrophysics; and applied physics. Some physics departments also support physics education research and physics outreach.[65]\\n\\nSince the 20th century, the individual fields of physics have become increasingly specialised, and today most physicists work in a single field for their entire careers. \"Universalists\" such as Einstein (1879–1955) and Lev Landau (1908–1968), who worked in multiple fields of physics, are now very rare.[h]\\n\\nThe major fields of physics, along with their subfields and the theories and concepts they employ, are shown in the following table.\\nField \\tSubfields \\tMajor theories \\tConcepts\\nNuclear and particle physics \\tNuclear physics, Nuclear astrophysics, Particle physics, Astroparticle physics, Particle physics phenomenology \\tStandard Model, Quantum field theory, Quantum electrodynamics, Quantum chromodynamics, Electroweak theory, Effective field theory, Lattice field theory, Gauge theory, Supersymmetry, Grand Unified Theory, Superstring theory, M-theory, AdS/CFT correspondence \\tFundamental interaction (gravitational, electromagnetic, weak, strong), Elementary particle, Spin, Antimatter, Spontaneous symmetry breaking, Neutrino oscillation, Seesaw mechanism, Brane, String, Quantum gravity, Theory of everything, Vacuum energy\\nAtomic, molecular, and optical physics \\tAtomic physics, Molecular physics, Atomic and molecular astrophysics, Chemical physics, Optics, Photonics \\tQuantum optics, Quantum chemistry, Quantum information science \\tPhoton, Atom, Molecule, Diffraction, Electromagnetic radiation, Laser, Polarization (waves), Spectral line, Casimir effect\\nCondensed matter physics \\tSolid-state physics, High-pressure physics, Low-temperature physics, Surface physics, Nanoscale and mesoscopic physics, Polymer physics \\tBCS theory, Bloch\\'s theorem, Density functional theory, Fermi gas, Fermi liquid theory, Many-body theory, Statistical mechanics \\tPhases (gas, liquid, solid), Bose–Einstein condensate, Electrical conduction, Phonon, Magnetism, Self-organization, Semiconductor, superconductor, superfluidity, Spin,\\nAstrophysics \\tAstronomy, Astrometry, Cosmology, Gravitation physics, High-energy astrophysics, Planetary astrophysics, Plasma physics, Solar physics, Space physics, Stellar astrophysics \\tBig Bang, Cosmic inflation, General relativity, Newton\\'s law of universal gravitation, Lambda-CDM model, Magnetohydrodynamics \\tBlack hole, Cosmic background radiation, Cosmic string, Cosmos, Dark energy, Dark matter, Galaxy, Gravity, Gravitational radiation, Gravitational singularity, Planet, Solar System, Star, Supernova, Universe\\nApplied physics \\tAccelerator physics, Acoustics, Agrophysics, Atmospheric physics, Biophysics, Chemical physics, Communication physics, Econophysics, Engineering physics, Fluid dynamics, Geophysics, Laser physics, Materials physics, Medical physics, Nanotechnology, Optics, Optoelectronics, Photonics, Photovoltaics, Physical chemistry, Physical oceanography, Physics of computation, Plasma physics, Solid-state devices, Quantum chemistry, Quantum electronics, Quantum information science, Vehicle dynamics\\nNuclear and particle\\nMain articles: Particle physics and Nuclear physics\\nA simulated event in the CMS detector of the Large Hadron Collider, featuring a possible appearance of the Higgs boson.\\n\\nParticle physics is the study of the elementary constituents of matter and energy and the interactions between them.[66] In addition, particle physicists design and develop the high-energy accelerators,[67] detectors,[68] and computer programs[69] necessary for this research. The field is also called \"high-energy physics\" because many elementary particles do not occur naturally but are created only during high-energy collisions of other particles.[70]\\n\\nCurrently, the interactions of elementary particles and fields are described by the Standard Model.[71] The model accounts for the 12 known particles of matter (quarks and leptons) that interact via the strong, weak, and electromagnetic fundamental forces.[71] Dynamics are described in terms of matter particles exchanging gauge bosons (gluons, W and Z bosons, and photons, respectively).[72] The Standard Model also predicts a particle known as the Higgs boson.[71] In July 2012 CERN, the European laboratory for particle physics, announced the detection of a particle consistent with the Higgs boson,[73] an integral part of the Higgs mechanism.\\n\\nNuclear physics is the field of physics that studies the constituents and interactions of atomic nuclei. The most commonly known applications of nuclear physics are nuclear power generation and nuclear weapons technology, but the research has provided application in many fields, including those in nuclear medicine and magnetic resonance imaging, ion implantation in materials engineering, and radiocarbon dating in geology and archaeology.\\nAtomic, molecular, and optical\\nMain article: Atomic, molecular, and optical physics\\n\\nAtomic, molecular, and optical physics (AMO) is the study of matter–matter and light–matter interactions on the scale of single atoms and molecules. The three areas are grouped together because of their interrelationships, the similarity of methods used, and the commonality of their relevant energy scales. All three areas include both classical, semi-classical and quantum treatments; they can treat their subject from a microscopic view (in contrast to a macroscopic view).\\n\\nAtomic physics studies the electron shells of atoms. Current research focuses on activities in quantum control, cooling and trapping of atoms and ions,[74][75][76] low-temperature collision dynamics and the effects of electron correlation on structure and dynamics. Atomic physics is influenced by the nucleus (see hyperfine splitting), but intra-nuclear phenomena such as fission and fusion are considered part of nuclear physics.\\n\\nMolecular physics focuses on multi-atomic structures and their internal and external interactions with matter and light. Optical physics is distinct from optics in that it tends to focus not on the control of classical light fields by macroscopic objects but on the fundamental properties of optical fields and their interactions with matter in the microscopic realm.\\nCondensed matter\\nMain article: Condensed matter physics\\nVelocity-distribution data of a gas of rubidium atoms, confirming the discovery of a new phase of matter, the Bose–Einstein condensate\\n\\nCondensed matter physics is the field of physics that deals with the macroscopic physical properties of matter.[77][78] In particular, it is concerned with the \"condensed\" phases that appear whenever the number of particles in a system is extremely large and the interactions between them are strong.[79]\\n\\nThe most familiar examples of condensed phases are solids and liquids, which arise from the bonding by way of the electromagnetic force between atoms.[80] More exotic condensed phases include the superfluid[81] and the Bose–Einstein condensate[82] found in certain atomic systems at very low temperature, the superconducting phase exhibited by conduction electrons in certain materials,[83] and the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases of spins on atomic lattices.[84]\\n\\nCondensed matter physics is the largest field of contemporary physics. Historically, condensed matter physics grew out of solid-state physics, which is now considered one of its main subfields.[85] The term condensed matter physics was apparently coined by Philip Anderson when he renamed his research group—previously solid-state theory—in 1967.[86] In 1978, the Division of Solid State Physics of the American Physical Society was renamed as the Division of Condensed Matter Physics.[85] Condensed matter physics has a large overlap with chemistry, materials science, nanotechnology and engineering.[79]\\nAstrophysics\\nMain articles: Astrophysics and Physical cosmology\\nThe deepest visible-light image of the universe, the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field\\n\\nAstrophysics and astronomy are the application of the theories and methods of physics to the study of stellar structure, stellar evolution, the origin of the Solar System, and related problems of cosmology. Because astrophysics is a broad subject, astrophysicists typically apply many disciplines of physics, including mechanics, electromagnetism, statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, relativity, nuclear and particle physics, and atomic and molecular physics.[87]\\n\\nThe discovery by Karl Jansky in 1931 that radio signals were emitted by celestial bodies initiated the science of radio astronomy. Most recently, the frontiers of astronomy have been expanded by space exploration. Perturbations and interference from the earth\\'s atmosphere make space-based observations necessary for infrared, ultraviolet, gamma-ray, and X-ray astronomy.\\n\\nPhysical cosmology is the study of the formation and evolution of the universe on its largest scales. Albert Einstein\\'s theory of relativity plays a central role in all modern cosmological theories. In the early 20th century, Hubble\\'s discovery that the universe is expanding, as shown by the Hubble diagram, prompted rival explanations known as the steady state universe and the Big Bang.\\n\\nThe Big Bang was confirmed by the success of Big Bang nucleosynthesis and the discovery of the cosmic microwave background in 1964. The Big Bang model rests on two theoretical pillars: Albert Einstein\\'s general relativity and the cosmological principle. Cosmologists have recently established the ΛCDM model of the evolution of the universe, which includes cosmic inflation, dark energy, and dark matter.\\n\\nNumerous possibilities and discoveries are anticipated to emerge from new data from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope over the upcoming decade and vastly revise or clarify existing models of the universe.[88][89] In particular, the potential for a tremendous discovery surrounding dark matter is possible over the next several years.[90] Fermi will search for evidence that dark matter is composed of weakly interacting massive particles, complementing similar experiments with the Large Hadron Collider and other underground detectors.\\n\\nIBEX is already yielding new astrophysical discoveries: \"No one knows what is creating the ENA (energetic neutral atoms) ribbon\" along the termination shock of the solar wind, \"but everyone agrees that it means the textbook picture of the heliosphere—in which the Solar System\\'s enveloping pocket filled with the solar wind\\'s charged particles is plowing through the onrushing \\'galactic wind\\' of the interstellar medium in the shape of a comet—is wrong.\"[91]\\nCurrent research\\nFurther information: List of unsolved problems in physics\\nFeynman diagram signed by R. P. Feynman.\\nA typical phenomenon described by physics: a magnet levitating above a superconductor demonstrates the Meissner effect.\\n\\nResearch in physics is continually progressing on a large number of fronts.\\n\\nIn condensed matter physics, an important unsolved theoretical problem is that of high-temperature superconductivity.[92] Many condensed matter experiments are aiming to fabricate workable spintronics and quantum computers.[79][93]\\n\\nIn particle physics, the first pieces of experimental evidence for physics beyond the Standard Model have begun to appear. Foremost among these are indications that neutrinos have non-zero mass. These experimental results appear to have solved the long-standing solar neutrino problem, and the physics of massive neutrinos remains an area of active theoretical and experimental research. The Large Hadron Collider has already found the Higgs boson, but future research aims to prove or disprove the supersymmetry, which extends the Standard Model of particle physics. Research on the nature of the major mysteries of dark matter and dark energy is also currently ongoing.[94]\\n\\nAlthough much progress has been made in high-energy, quantum, and astronomical physics, many everyday phenomena involving complexity,[95] chaos,[96] or turbulence[97] are still poorly understood. Complex problems that seem like they could be solved by a clever application of dynamics and mechanics remain unsolved; examples include the formation of sandpiles, nodes in trickling water, the shape of water droplets, mechanisms of surface tension catastrophes, and self-sorting in shaken heterogeneous collections.[i][98]\\n\\nThese complex phenomena have received growing attention since the 1970s for several reasons, including the availability of modern mathematical methods and computers, which enabled complex systems to be modeled in new ways. Complex physics has become part of increasingly interdisciplinary research, as exemplified by the study of turbulence in aerodynamics and the observation of pattern formation in biological systems. In the 1932 Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics, Horace Lamb said:[99]\\n\\n    I am an old man now, and when I die and go to heaven there are two matters on which I hope for enlightenment. One is quantum electrodynamics, and the other is the turbulent motion of fluids. And about the former I am rather optimistic.\\n\\nSee also\\n\\n    iconPhysics portal\\n\\n    List of important publications in physics\\n    List of physicists\\n    Lists of physics equations\\n    Relationship between mathematics and physics\\n    Earth science\\n    Neurophysics\\n    Psychophysics\\n    Science tourism\\n    Quantum physics\\n\\nNotes\\n\\nAt the start of The Feynman Lectures on Physics, Richard Feynman offers the atomic hypothesis as the single most prolific scientific concept.[1]\\nThe term \"universe\" is defined as everything that physically exists: the entirety of space and time, all forms of matter, energy and momentum, and the physical laws and constants that govern them. However, the term \"universe\" may also be used in slightly different contextual senses, denoting concepts such as the cosmos or the philosophical world.\\nFrancis Bacon\\'s 1620 Novum Organum was critical in the development of scientific method.[7]\\nCalculus was independently developed at around the same time by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz; while Leibniz was the first to publish his work and develop much of the notation used for calculus today, Newton was the first to develop calculus and apply it to physical problems. See also Leibniz–Newton calculus controversy\\nNoll notes that some universities still use this title.[37]\\nSee, for example, the influence of Kant and Ritter on Ørsted.\\nConcepts which are denoted hypothetical can change with time. For example, the atom of nineteenth-century physics was denigrated by some, including Ernst Mach\\'s critique of Ludwig Boltzmann\\'s formulation of statistical mechanics. By the end of World War II, the atom was no longer deemed hypothetical.\\nYet, universalism is encouraged in the culture of physics. For example, the World Wide Web, which was innovated at CERN by Tim Berners-Lee, was created in service to the computer infrastructure of CERN, and was/is intended for use by physicists worldwide. The same might be said for arXiv.org\\n\\n    See the work of Ilya Prigogine, on \\'systems far from equilibrium\\', and others.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nFeynman, Leighton & Sands 1963, p.

Another major theme is evolution, which explains the unity and diversity of life.[1][2][3] Energy processing is also important to life as it allows organisms to move, grow, and reproduce.[1][2][3] Finally, all organisms are able to regulate their own internal environments.[1][2][3][4][5]\\n\\nBiologists are able to study life at multiple levels of organization,[1] from the molecular biology of a cell to the anatomy and physiology of plants and animals, and evolution of populations.[1][6] Hence, there are multiple subdisciplines within biology, each defined by the nature of their research questions and the tools that they use.[7][8][9] Like other scientists, biologists use the scientific method to make observations, pose questions, generate hypotheses, perform experiments, and form conclusions about the world around them.[1]\\n\\nLife on Earth, which emerged more than 3.7 billion years ago,[10] is immensely diverse. Biologists have sought to study and classify the various forms of life, from prokaryotic organisms such as archaea and bacteria to eukaryotic organisms such as protists, fungi, plants, and animals. These various organisms contribute to the biodiversity of an ecosystem, where they play specialized roles in the cycling of nutrients and energy through their biophysical environment.\\nHistory\\nMain article: History of biology\\nA drawing of a fly from facing up, with wing detail\\nDiagram of a fly from Robert Hooke\\'s innovative Micrographia, 1665.\\n\\nThe earliest of roots of science, which included medicine, can be traced to ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia in around 3000 to 1200 BCE.[11][12] Their contributions shaped ancient Greek natural philosophy.[11][12][13][14] Ancient Greek philosophers such as Aristotle (384–322 BCE) contributed extensively to the development of biological knowledge. He explored biological causation and the diversity of life. His successor, Theophrastus, began the scientific study of plants.[15] Scholars of the medieval Islamic world who wrote on biology included al-Jahiz (781–869), Al-Dīnawarī (828–896), who wrote on botany,[16] and Rhazes (865–925) who wrote on anatomy and physiology. Medicine was especially well studied by Islamic scholars working in Greek philosopher traditions, while natural history drew heavily on Aristotelian thought.\\n\\nBiology began to quickly develop with Anton van Leeuwenhoek\\'s dramatic improvement of the microscope. It was then that scholars discovered spermatozoa, bacteria, infusoria and the diversity of microscopic life. Investigations by Jan Swammerdam led to new interest in entomology and helped to develop techniques of microscopic dissection and staining.[17] Advances in microscopy had a profound impact on biological thinking. In the early 19th century, biologists pointed to the central importance of the cell. In 1838, Schleiden and Schwann began promoting the now universal ideas that (1) the basic unit of organisms is the cell and (2) that individual cells have all the characteristics of life, although they opposed the idea that (3) all cells come from the division of other cells, continuing to support spontaneous generation. However, Robert Remak and Rudolf Virchow were able to reify the third tenet, and by the 1860s most biologists accepted all three tenets which consolidated into cell theory.[18][19]\\n\\nMeanwhile, taxonomy and classification became the focus of natural historians. Carl Linnaeus published a basic taxonomy for the natural world in 1735, and in the 1750s introduced scientific names for all his species.[20] Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, treated species as artificial categories and living forms as malleable—even suggesting the possibility of common descent.[21]\\nIn 1842, Charles Darwin penned his first sketch of On the Origin of Species.[22]\\n\\nSerious evolutionary thinking originated with the works of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, who presented a coherent theory of evolution.[23] The British naturalist Charles Darwin, combining the biogeographical approach of Humboldt, the uniformitarian geology of Lyell, Malthus\\'s writings on population growth, and his own morphological expertise and extensive natural observations, forged a more successful evolutionary theory based on natural selection; similar reasoning and evidence led Alfred Russel Wallace to independently reach the same conclusions.[24][25]\\n\\nThe basis for modern genetics began with the work of Gregor Mendel in 1865.[26] This outlined the principles of biological inheritance.[27] However, the significance of his work was not realized until the early 20th century when evolution became a unified theory as the modern synthesis reconciled Darwinian evolution with classical genetics.[28] In the 1940s and early 1950s, a series of experiments by Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase pointed to DNA as the component of chromosomes that held the trait-carrying units that had become known as genes. A focus on new kinds of model organisms such as viruses and bacteria, along with the discovery of the double-helical structure of DNA by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953, marked the transition to the era of molecular genetics. From the 1950s onwards, biology has been vastly extended in the molecular domain. The genetic code was cracked by Har Gobind Khorana, Robert W. Holley and Marshall Warren Nirenberg after DNA was understood to contain codons. The Human Genome Project was launched in 1990 to map the human genome.[29]\\nChemical basis\\nAtoms and molecules\\nFurther information: Chemistry\\n\\nAll organisms are made up of chemical elements;[30] oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen account for most (96%) of the mass of all organisms, with calcium, phosphorus, sulfur, sodium, chlorine, and magnesium constituting essentially all the remainder. Different elements can combine to form compounds such as water, which is fundamental to life.[30] Biochemistry is the study of chemical processes within and relating to living organisms. Molecular biology is the branch of biology that seeks to understand the molecular basis of biological activity in and between cells, including molecular synthesis, modification, mechanisms, and interactions.\\nWater\\nModel of hydrogen bonds (1) between molecules of water\\nSee also: Planetary habitability, Circumstellar habitable zone, and Water distribution on Earth\\n\\nLife arose from the Earth\\'s first ocean, which formed some 3.8 billion years ago.[31] Since then, water continues to be the most abundant molecule in every organism. Water is important to life because it is an effective solvent, capable of dissolving solutes such as sodium and chloride ions or other small molecules to form an aqueous solution. Once dissolved in water, these solutes are more likely to come in contact with one another and therefore take part in chemical reactions that sustain life.[31] In terms of its molecular structure, water is a small polar molecule with a bent shape formed by the polar covalent bonds of two hydrogen (H) atoms to one oxygen (O) atom (H2O).[31] Because the O–H bonds are polar, the oxygen atom has a slight negative charge and the two hydrogen atoms have a slight positive charge.[31] This polar property of water allows it to attract other water molecules via hydrogen bonds, which makes water cohesive.[31] Surface tension results from the cohesive force due to the attraction between molecules at the surface of the liquid.[31] Water is also adhesive as it is able to adhere to the surface of any polar or charged non-water molecules.[31] Water is denser as a liquid than it is as a solid (or ice).[31] This unique property of water allows ice to float above liquid water such as ponds, lakes, and oceans, thereby insulating the liquid below from the cold air above.[31] Water has the capacity to absorb energy, giving it a higher specific heat capacity than other solvents such as ethanol.[31] Thus, a large amount of energy is needed to break the hydrogen bonds between water molecules to convert liquid water into water vapor.[31] As a molecule, water is not completely stable as each water molecule continuously dissociates into hydrogen and hydroxyl ions before reforming into a water molecule again.[31] In pure water, the number of hydrogen ions balances (or equals) the number of hydroxyl ions, resulting in a pH that is neutral.\\nOrganic compounds\\nFurther information: Organic chemistry\\nOrganic compounds such as glucose are vital to organisms.\\n\\nOrganic compounds are molecules that contain carbon bonded to another element such as hydrogen.[31] With the exception of water, nearly all the molecules that make up each organism contain carbon.[31][32] Carbon can form covalent bonds with up to four other atoms, enabling it to form diverse, large, and complex molecules.[31][32] For example, a single carbon atom can form four single covalent bonds such as in methane, two double covalent bonds such as in carbon dioxide (CO2), or a triple covalent bond such as in carbon monoxide (CO). Moreover, carbon can form very long chains of interconnecting carbon–carbon bonds such as octane or ring-like structures such as glucose.\\n\\nThe simplest form of an organic molecule is the hydrocarbon, which is a large family of organic compounds that are composed of hydrogen atoms bonded to a chain of carbon atoms. A hydrocarbon backbone can be substituted by other elements such as oxygen (O), hydrogen (H), phosphorus (P), and sulfur (S), which can change the chemical behavior of that compound.[31] Groups of atoms that contain these elements (O-, H-, P-, and S-) and are bonded to a central carbon atom or skeleton are called functional groups.[31] There are six prominent functional groups that can be found in organisms: amino group, carboxyl group, carbonyl group, hydroxyl group, phosphate group, and sulfhydryl group.[31]\\n\\nIn 1953, the Miller-Urey experiment showed that organic compounds could be synthesized abiotically within a closed system mimicking the conditions of early Earth, thus suggesting that complex organic molecules could have arisen spontaneously in early Earth (see abiogenesis).[33][31]\\nMacromolecules\\nMain article: Macromolecule\\nThe (a) primary, (b) secondary, (c) tertiary, and (d) quaternary structures of a hemoglobin protein\\n\\nMacromolecules are large molecules made up of smaller subunits or monomers.[34] Monomers include sugars, amino acids, and nucleotides.[35] Carbohydrates include monomers and polymers of sugars.[36] Lipids are the only class of macromolecules that are not made up of polymers. They include steroids, phospholipids, and fats,[35] largely nonpolar and hydrophobic (water-repelling) substances.[37] Proteins are the most diverse of the macromolecules. They include enzymes, transport proteins, large signaling molecules, antibodies, and structural proteins. The basic unit (or monomer) of a protein is an amino acid.[34] Twenty amino acids are used in proteins.[34] Nucleic acids are polymers of nucleotides.[38] Their function is to store, transmit, and express hereditary information.[35]\\nCells\\nMain article: Cell (biology)\\n\\nCell theory states that cells are the fundamental units of life, that all living things are composed of one or more cells, and that all cells arise from preexisting cells through cell division.[39] Most cells are very small, with diameters ranging from 1 to 100 micrometers and are therefore only visible under a light or electron microscope.[40] There are generally two types of cells: eukaryotic cells, which contain a nucleus, and prokaryotic cells, which do not. Prokaryotes are single-celled organisms such as bacteria, whereas eukaryotes can be single-celled or multicellular. In multicellular organisms, every cell in the organism\\'s body is derived ultimately from a single cell in a fertilized egg.\\nCell structure\\nStructure of an animal cell depicting various organelles\\n\\nEvery cell is enclosed within a cell membrane that separates its cytoplasm from the extracellular space.[41] A cell membrane consists of a lipid bilayer, including cholesterols that sit between phospholipids to maintain their fluidity at various temperatures. Cell membranes are semipermeable, allowing small molecules such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water to pass through while restricting the movement of larger molecules and charged particles such as ions.[42] Cell membranes also contains membrane proteins, including integral membrane proteins that go across the membrane serving as membrane transporters, and peripheral proteins that loosely attach to the outer side of the cell membrane, acting as enzymes shaping the cell.[43] Cell membranes are involved in various cellular processes such as cell adhesion, storing electrical energy, and cell signalling and serve as the attachment surface for several extracellular structures such as a cell wall, glycocalyx, and cytoskeleton.\\nStructure of a plant cell\\n\\nWithin the cytoplasm of a cell, there are many biomolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids.[44] In addition to biomolecules, eukaryotic cells have specialized structures called organelles that have their own lipid bilayers or are spatially units.[45] These organelles include the cell nucleus, which contains most of the cell\\'s DNA, or mitochondria, which generates adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to power cellular processes. Other organelles such as endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus play a role in the synthesis and packaging of proteins, respectively. Biomolecules such as proteins can be engulfed by lysosomes, another specialized organelle. Plant cells have additional organelles that distinguish them from animal cells such as a cell wall that provides support for the plant cell, chloroplasts that harvest sunlight energy to produce sugar, and vacuoles that provide storage and structural support as well as being involved in reproduction and breakdown of plant seeds.[45] Eukaryotic cells also have cytoskeleton that is made up of microtubules, intermediate filaments, and microfilaments, all of which provide support for the cell and are involved in the movement of the cell and its organelles.[45] In terms of their structural composition, the microtubules are made up of tubulin (e.g., α-tubulin and β-tubulin whereas intermediate filaments are made up of fibrous proteins.[45] Microfilaments are made up of actin molecules that interact with other strands of proteins.[45]\\nMetabolism\\nFurther information: Bioenergetics\\nExample of an enzyme-catalysed exothermic reaction\\n\\nAll cells require energy to sustain cellular processes. Metabolism is the set of chemical reactions in an organism. The three main purposes of metabolism are: the conversion of food to energy to run cellular processes; the conversion of food/fuel to monomer building blocks; and the elimination of metabolic wastes. These enzyme-catalyzed reactions allow organisms to grow and reproduce, maintain their structures, and respond to their environments. Metabolic reactions may be categorized as catabolic—the breaking down of compounds (for example, the breaking down of glucose to pyruvate by cellular respiration); or anabolic—the building up (synthesis) of compounds (such as proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids). Usually, catabolism releases energy, and anabolism consumes energy. The chemical reactions of metabolism are organized into metabolic pathways, in which one chemical is transformed through a series of steps into another chemical, each step being facilitated by a specific enzyme. Enzymes are crucial to metabolism because they allow organisms to drive desirable reactions that require energy that will not occur by themselves, by coupling them to spontaneous reactions that release energy. Enzymes act as catalysts—they allow a reaction to proceed more rapidly without being consumed by it—by reducing the amount of activation energy needed to convert reactants into products. Enzymes also allow the regulation of the rate of a metabolic reaction, for example in response to changes in the cell\\'s environment or to signals from other cells.\\nCellular respiration\\nMain article: Cellular respiration\\nRespiration in a eukaryotic cell\\n\\nCellular respiration is a set of metabolic reactions and processes that take place in cells to convert chemical energy from nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and then release waste products.[46] The reactions involved in respiration are catabolic reactions, which break large molecules into smaller ones, releasing energy. Respiration is one of the key ways a cell releases chemical energy to fuel cellular activity. The overall reaction occurs in a series of biochemical steps, some of which are redox reactions. Although cellular respiration is technically a combustion reaction, it clearly does not resemble one when it occurs in a cell because of the slow, controlled release of energy from the series of reactions.\\n\\nSugar in the form of glucose is the main nutrient used by animal and plant cells in respiration. Cellular respiration involving oxygen is called aerobic respiration, which has four stages: glycolysis, citric acid cycle (or Krebs cycle), electron transport chain, and oxidative phosphorylation.[47] Glycolysis is a metabolic process that occurs in the cytoplasm whereby glucose is converted into two pyruvates, with two net molecules of ATP being produced at the same time.[47] Each pyruvate is then oxidized into acetyl-CoA by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, which also generates NADH and carbon dioxide. Acetyl-Coa enters the citric acid cycle, which takes places inside the mitochondrial matrix. At the end of the cycle, the total yield from 1 glucose (or 2 pyruvates) is 6 NADH, 2 FADH2, and 2 ATP molecules. Finally, the next stage is oxidative phosphorylation, which in eukaryotes, occurs in the mitochondrial cristae. Oxidative phosphorylation comprises the electron transport chain, which is a series of four protein complexes that transfer electrons from one complex to another, thereby releasing energy from NADH and FADH2 that is coupled to the pumping of protons (hydrogen ions) across the inner mitochondrial membrane (chemiosmosis), which generates a proton motive force.[47] Energy from the proton motive force drives the enzyme ATP synthase to synthesize more ATPs by phosphorylating ADPs. The transfer of electrons terminates with molecular oxygen being the final electron acceptor.\\n\\nIf oxygen were not present, pyruvate would not be metabolized by cellular respiration but undergoes a process of fermentation. The pyruvate is not transported into the mitochondrion but remains in the cytoplasm, where it is converted to waste products that may be removed from the cell. This serves the purpose of oxidizing the electron carriers so that they can perform glycolysis again and removing the excess pyruvate. Fermentation oxidizes NADH to NAD+ so it can be re-used in glycolysis. In the absence of oxygen, fermentation prevents the buildup of NADH in the cytoplasm and provides NAD+ for glycolysis. This waste product varies depending on the organism. In skeletal muscles, the waste product is lactic acid. This type of fermentation is called lactic acid fermentation. In strenuous exercise, when energy demands exceed energy supply, the respiratory chain cannot process all of the hydrogen atoms joined by NADH. During anaerobic glycolysis, NAD+ regenerates when pairs of hydrogen combine with pyruvate to form lactate. Lactate formation is catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase in a reversible reaction. Lactate can also be used as an indirect precursor for liver glycogen. During recovery, when oxygen becomes available, NAD+ attaches to hydrogen from lactate to form ATP. In yeast, the waste products are ethanol and carbon dioxide. This type of fermentation is known as alcoholic or ethanol fermentation. The ATP generated in this process is made by substrate-level phosphorylation, which does not require oxygen.\\nPhotosynthesis\\nPhotosynthesis changes sunlight into chemical energy, splits water to liberate O2, and fixes CO2 into sugar.\\nMain article: Photosynthesis\\n\\nPhotosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy into chemical energy that can later be released to fuel the organism\\'s metabolic activities via cellular respiration. This chemical energy is stored in carbohydrate molecules, such as sugars, which are synthesized from carbon dioxide and water.[48][49][50] In most cases, oxygen is released as a waste product. Most plants, algae, and cyanobacteria perform photosynthesis, which is largely responsible for producing and maintaining the oxygen content of the Earth\\'s atmosphere, and supplies most of the energy necessary for life on Earth.[51]\\n\\nPhotosynthesis has four stages: Light absorption, electron transport, ATP synthesis, and carbon fixation.[47] Light absorption is the initial step of photosynthesis whereby light energy is absorbed by chlorophyll pigments attached to proteins in the thylakoid membranes. The absorbed light energy is used to remove electrons from a donor (water) to a primary electron acceptor, a quinone designated as Q. In the second stage, electrons move from the quinone primary electron acceptor through a series of electron carriers until they reach a final electron acceptor, which is usually the oxidized form of NADP+, which is reduced to NADPH, a process that takes place in a protein complex called photosystem I (PSI). The transport of electrons is coupled to the movement of protons (or hydrogen) from the stroma to the thylakoid membrane, which forms a pH gradient across the membrane as hydrogen becomes more concentrated in the lumen than in the stroma. This is analogous to the proton-motive force generated across the inner mitochondrial membrane in aerobic respiration.[47]\\n\\nDuring the third stage of photosynthesis, the movement of protons down their concentration gradients from the thylakoid lumen to the stroma through the ATP synthase is coupled to the synthesis of ATP by that same ATP synthase.[47] The NADPH and ATPs generated by the light-dependent reactions in the second and third stages, respectively, provide the energy and electrons to drive the synthesis of glucose by fixing atmospheric carbon dioxide into existing organic carbon compounds, such as ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP) in a sequence of light-independent (or dark) reactions called the Calvin cycle.[52]\\nCell signaling\\nMain article: Cell signaling\\n\\nCell signaling (or communication) is the ability of cells to receive, process, and transmit signals with its environment and with itself.[53][54] Signals can be non-chemical such as light, electrical impulses, and heat, or chemical signals (or ligands) that interact with receptors, which can be found embedded in the cell membrane of another cell or located deep inside a cell.[55][54] There are generally four types of chemical signals: autocrine, paracrine, juxtacrine, and hormones.[55] In autocrine signaling, the ligand affects the same cell that releases it. Tumor cells, for example, can reproduce uncontrollably because they release signals that initiate their own self-division. In paracrine signaling, the ligand diffuses to nearby cells and affects them. For example, brain cells called neurons release ligands called neurotransmitters that diffuse across a synaptic cleft to bind with a receptor on an adjacent cell such as another neuron or muscle cell. In juxtacrine signaling, there is direct contact between the signaling and responding cells. Finally, hormones are ligands that travel through the circulatory systems of animals or vascular systems of plants to reach their target cells. Once a ligand binds with a receptor, it can influence the behavior of another cell, depending on the type of receptor. For instance, neurotransmitters that bind with an inotropic receptor can alter the excitability of a target cell. Other types of receptors include protein kinase receptors (e.g., receptor for the hormone insulin) and G protein-coupled receptors. Activation of G protein-coupled receptors can initiate second messenger cascades. The process by which a chemical or physical signal is transmitted through a cell as a series of molecular events is called signal transduction\\nCell cycle\\nIn meiosis, the chromosomes duplicate and the homologous chromosomes exchange genetic information during meiosis I. The daughter cells divide again in meiosis II to form haploid gametes.\\nMain article: Cell cycle\\n\\nThe cell cycle is a series of events that take place in a cell that cause it to divide into two daughter cells. These events include the duplication of its DNA and some of its organelles, and the subsequent partitioning of its cytoplasm into two daughter cells in a process called cell division.[56] In eukaryotes (i.e., animal, plant, fungal, and protist cells), there are two distinct types of cell division: mitosis and meiosis.[57] Mitosis is part of the cell cycle, in which replicated chromosomes are separated into two new nuclei. Cell division gives rise to genetically identical cells in which the total number of chromosomes is maintained. In general, mitosis (division of the nucleus) is preceded by the S stage of interphase (during which the DNA is replicated) and is often followed by telophase and cytokinesis; which divides the cytoplasm, organelles and cell membrane of one cell into two new cells containing roughly equal shares of these cellular components. The different stages of mitosis all together define the mitotic phase of an animal cell cycle—the division of the mother cell into two genetically identical daughter cells.[58] The cell cycle is a vital process by which a single-celled fertilized egg develops into a mature organism, as well as the process by which hair, skin, blood cells, and some internal organs are renewed. After cell division, each of the daughter cells begin the interphase of a new cycle. In contrast to mitosis, meiosis results in four haploid daughter cells by undergoing one round of DNA replication followed by two divisions.[59] Homologous chromosomes are separated in the first division (meiosis I), and sister chromatids are separated in the second division (meiosis II). Both of these cell division cycles are used in the process of sexual reproduction at some point in their life cycle. Both are believed to be present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor.\\n\\nProkaryotes (i.e., archaea and bacteria) can also undergo cell division (or binary fission). Unlike the processes of mitosis and meiosis in eukaryotes, binary fission takes in prokaryotes takes place without the formation of a spindle apparatus on the cell. Before binary fission, DNA in the bacterium is tightly coiled. After it has uncoiled and duplicated, it is pulled to the separate poles of the bacterium as it increases the size to prepare for splitting. Growth of a new cell wall begins to separate the bacterium (triggered by FtsZ polymerization and \"Z-ring\" formation)[60] The new cell wall (septum) fully develops, resulting in the complete split of the bacterium. The new daughter cells have tightly coiled DNA rods, ribosomes, and plasmids.\\nGenetics\\nInheritance\\nMain article: Classical genetics\\nPunnett square depicting a cross between two pea plants heterozygous for purple (B) and white (b) blossoms\\n\\nGenetics is the scientific study of inheritance.[61][62][63] Mendelian inheritance, specifically, is the process by which genes and traits are passed on from parents to offspring.[27] It has several principles. The first is that genetic characteristics, alleles, are discrete and have alternate forms (e.g., purple vs. white or tall vs. dwarf), each inherited from one of two parents. Based on the law of dominance and uniformity, which states that some alleles are dominant while others are recessive; an organism with at least one dominant allele will display the phenotype of that dominant allele.[64] During gamete formation, the alleles for each gene segregate, so that each gamete carries only one allele for each gene. Heterozygotic individuals produce gametes with an equal frequency of two alleles. Finally, the law of independent assortment, states that genes of different traits can segregate independently during the formation of gametes, i.e., genes are unlinked. An exception to this rule would include traits that are sex-linked. Test crosses can be performed to experimentally determine the underlying genotype of an organism with a dominant phenotype.[65] A Punnett square can be used to predict the results of a test cross. The chromosome theory of inheritance, which states that genes are found on chromosomes, was supported by Thomas Morgans\\'s experiments with fruit flies, which established the sex linkage between eye color and sex in these insects.[66]\\nGenes and DNA\\nBases lie between two spiraling DNA strands.\\nFurther information: Gene and DNA\\n\\nA gene is a unit of heredity that corresponds to a region of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) that carries genetic information that controls form or function of an organism. DNA is composed of two polynucleotide chains that coil around each other to form a double helix.[67] It is found as linear chromosomes in eukaryotes, and circular chromosomes in prokaryotes. The set of chromosomes in a cell is collectively known as its genome. In eukaryotes, DNA is mainly in the cell nucleus.[68] In prokaryotes, the DNA is held within the nucleoid.[69] The genetic information is held within genes, and the complete assemblage in an organism is called its genotype.[70] DNA replication is a semiconservative process whereby each strand serves as a template for a new strand of DNA.[67] Mutations are heritable changes in DNA.[67] They can arise spontaneously as a result of replication errors that were not corrected by proofreading or can be induced by an environmental mutagen such as a chemical (e.g., nitrous acid, benzopyrene) or radiation (e.g., x-ray, gamma ray, ultraviolet radiation, particles emitted by unstable isotopes).[67] Mutations can lead to phenotypic effects such as loss-of-function, gain-of-function, and conditional mutations.[67] Some mutations are beneficial, as they are a source of genetic variation for evolution.[67] Others are harmful if they were to result in a loss of function of genes needed for survival.[67] Mutagens such as carcinogens are typically avoided as a matter of public health policy goals.[67]\\nGene expression\\nThe extended central dogma of molecular biology includes all the processes involved in the flow of genetic information.\\nMain article: Gene expression\\n\\nGene expression is the molecular process by which a genotype encoded in DNA gives rise to an observable phenotype in the proteins of an organism\\'s body. This process is summarized by the central dogma of molecular biology, which was formulated by Francis Crick in 1958.[71][72][73] According to the Central Dogma, genetic information flows from DNA to RNA to protein. There are two gene expression processes: transcription (DNA to RNA) and translation (RNA to protein).[74]\\nGene regulation\\nMain article: Regulation of gene expression\\n\\nThe regulation of gene expression by environmental factors and during different stages of development can occur at each step of the process such as transcription, RNA splicing, translation, and post-translational modification of a protein.[75] Gene expression can be influenced by positive or negative regulation, depending on which of the two types of regulatory proteins called transcription factors bind to the DNA sequence close to or at a promoter.[75] A cluster of genes that share the same promoter is called an operon, found mainly in prokaryotes and some lower eukaryotes (e.g., Caenorhabditis elegans).[75][76] In positive regulation of gene expression, the activator is the transcription factor that stimulates transcription when it binds to the sequence near or at the promoter. Negative regulation occurs when another transcription factor called a repressor binds to a DNA sequence called an operator, which is part of an operon, to prevent transcription. Repressors can be inhibited by compounds called inducers (e.g., allolactose), thereby allowing transcription to occur.[75] Specific genes that can be activated by inducers are called inducible genes, in contrast to constitutive genes that are almost constantly active.[75] In contrast to both, structural genes encode proteins that are not involved in gene regulation.[75] In addition to regulatory events involving the promoter, gene expression can also be regulated by epigenetic changes to chromatin, which is a complex of DNA and protein found in eukaryotic cells.[75]\\nGenes, development, and evolution\\nMain article: Evolutionary developmental biology\\n\\nDevelopment is the process by which a multicellular organism (plant or animal) goes through a series of changes, starting from a single cell, and taking on various forms that are characteristic of its life cycle.[77] There are four key processes that underlie development: Determination, differentiation, morphogenesis, and growth. Determination sets the developmental fate of a cell, which becomes more restrictive during development. Differentiation is the process by which specialized cells from less specialized cells such as stem cells.[78][79] Stem cells are undifferentiated or partially differentiated cells that can differentiate into various types of cells and proliferate indefinitely to produce more of the same stem cell.[80] Cellular differentiation dramatically changes a cell\\'s size, shape, membrane potential, metabolic activity, and responsiveness to signals, which are largely due to highly controlled modifications in gene expression and epigenetics. With a few exceptions, cellular differentiation almost never involves a change in the DNA sequence itself.[81] Thus, different cells can have very different physical characteristics despite having the same genome. Morphogenesis, or the development of body form, is the result of spatial differences in gene expression.[77] A small fraction of the genes in an organism\\'s genome called the developmental-genetic toolkit control the development of that organism. These toolkit genes are highly conserved among phyla, meaning that they are ancient and very similar in widely separated groups of animals. Differences in deployment of toolkit genes affect the body plan and the number, identity, and pattern of body parts. Among the most important toolkit genes are the Hox genes. Hox genes determine where repeating parts, such as the many vertebrae of snakes, will grow in a developing embryo or larva.[82]\\nEvolution\\nEvolutionary processes\\nMain article: Evolutionary biology\\nNatural selection for darker traits\\n\\nEvolution is a central organizing concept in biology. It is the change in heritable characteristics of populations over successive generations.[83][84] In artificial selection, animals were selectively bred for specific traits. [85] Given that traits are inherited, populations contain a varied mix of traits, and reproduction is able to increase any population, Darwin argued that in the natural world, it was nature that played the role of humans in selecting for specific traits.[85] Darwin inferred that individuals who possessed heritable traits better adapted to their environments are more likely to survive and produce more offspring than other individuals.[85] He further inferred that this would lead to the accumulation of favorable traits over successive generations, thereby increasing the match between the organisms and their environment.[86][87][88][85][89]\\nSpeciation\\nMain article: Speciation\\n\\nA species is a group of organisms that mate with one another and speciation is the process by which one lineage splits into two lineages as a result of having evolved independently from each other.[90] For speciation to occur, there has to be reproductive isolation.[90] Reproductive isolation can result from incompatibilities between genes as described by Bateson–Dobzhansky–Muller model. Reproductive isolation also tends to increase with genetic divergence. Speciation can occur when there are physical barriers that divide an ancestral species, a process known as allopatric speciation.[90]\\nPhylogeny\\nMain article: Phylogenetics\\nPhylogenetic tree showing the domains of bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes\\n\\n\\nA phylogeny is an evolutionary history of a specific group of organisms or their genes.[91] It can be represented using a phylogenetic tree, a diagram showing lines of descent among organisms or their genes. Each line drawn on the time axis of a tree represents a lineage of descendants of a particular species or population. When a lineage divides into two, it is represented as a fork or split on the phylogenetic tree.[91] Phylogenetic trees are the basis for comparing and grouping different species.[91] Different species that share a feature inherited from a common ancestor are described as having homologous features (or synapomorphy).[92][93][91] Phylogeny provides the basis of biological classification.[91] This classification system is rank-based, with the highest rank being the domain followed by kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species.[91] All organisms can be classified as belonging to one of three domains: Archaea (originally Archaebacteria); bacteria (originally eubacteria), or eukarya (includes the protist, fungi, plant, and animal kingdoms).[94]\\nHistory of life\\nMain article: History of life\\n\\nThe history of life on Earth traces how organisms have evolved from the earliest emergence of life to present day. Earth formed about 4.5 billion years ago and all life on Earth, both living and extinct, descended from a last universal common ancestor that lived about 3.5 billion years ago.[95][96] Geologists have developed a geologic time scale that divides the history of the Earth into major divisions, starting with four eons (Hadean, Archean, Proterozoic, and Phanerozoic), the first three of which are collectively known as the Precambrian, which lasted approximately 4 billion years.[97] Each eon can be divided into eras, with the Phanerozoic eon that began 539 million years ago[98] being subdivided into Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic eras.[97] These three eras together comprise eleven periods (Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous, Permian, Triassic, Jurassic, Cretaceous, Tertiary, and Quaternary).[97]\\n\\nThe similarities among all known present-day species indicate that they have diverged through the process of evolution from their common ancestor.[99] Biologists regard the ubiquity of the genetic code as evidence of universal common descent for all bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes.[100][10][101][102] Microbal mats of coexisting bacteria and archaea were the dominant form of life in the early Archean epoch and many of the major steps in early evolution are thought to have taken place in this environment.[103] The earliest evidence of eukaryotes dates from 1.85 billion years ago,[104][105] and while they may have been present earlier, their diversification accelerated when they started using oxygen in their metabolism. Later, around 1.7 billion years ago, multicellular organisms began to appear, with differentiated cells performing specialised functions.[106]\\n\\nAlgae-like multicellular land plants are dated back even to about 1 billion years ago,[107] although evidence suggests that microorganisms formed the earliest terrestrial ecosystems, at least 2.7 billion years ago.[108] Microorganisms are thought to have paved the way for the inception of land plants in the Ordovician period. Land plants were so successful that they are thought to have contributed to the Late Devonian extinction event.[109]\\n\\nEdiacara biota appear during the Ediacaran period,[110] while vertebrates, along with most other modern phyla originated about 525 million years ago during the Cambrian explosion.[111] During the Permian period, synapsids, including the ancestors of mammals, dominated the land,[112] but most of this group became extinct in the Permian–Triassic extinction event 252 million years ago.[113] During the recovery from this catastrophe, archosaurs became the most abundant land vertebrates;[114] one archosaur group, the dinosaurs, dominated the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods.[115] After the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event 66 million years ago killed off the non-avian dinosaurs,[116] mammals increased rapidly in size and diversity.[117] Such mass extinctions may have accelerated evolution by providing opportunities for new groups of organisms to diversify.[118]\\nDiversity\\nBacteria and Archaea\\nFurther information: Microbiology\\nBacteria – Gemmatimonas aurantiaca (-=1 Micrometer)\\n\\nBacteria are a type of cell that constitute a large domain of prokaryotic microorganisms. Typically a few micrometers in length, bacteria have a number of shapes, ranging from spheres to rods and spirals. Bacteria were among the first life forms to appear on Earth, and are present in most of its habitats. Bacteria inhabit soil, water, acidic hot springs, radioactive waste,[119] and the deep biosphere of the earth\\'s crust. Bacteria also live in symbiotic and parasitic relationships with plants and animals. Most bacteria have not been characterised, and only about 27 percent of the bacterial phyla have species that can be grown in the laboratory.[120]\\nArchaea – Halobacteria\\n\\nArchaea constitute the other domain of prokaryotic cells and were initially classified as bacteria, receiving the name archaebacteria (in the Archaebacteria kingdom), a term that has fallen out of use.[121] Archaeal cells have unique properties separating them from the other two domains, Bacteria and Eukaryota. Archaea are further divided into multiple recognized phyla. Archaea and bacteria are generally similar in size and shape, although a few archaea have very different shapes, such as the flat and square cells of Haloquadratum walsbyi.[122] Despite this morphological similarity to bacteria, archaea possess genes and several metabolic pathways that are more closely related to those of eukaryotes, notably for the enzymes involved in transcription and translation. Other aspects of archaeal biochemistry are unique, such as their reliance on ether lipids in their cell membranes,[123] including archaeols. Archaea use more energy sources than eukaryotes: these range from organic compounds, such as sugars, to ammonia, metal ions or even hydrogen gas. Salt-tolerant archaea (the Haloarchaea) use sunlight as an energy source, and other species of archaea fix carbon, but unlike plants and cyanobacteria, no known species of archaea does both. Archaea reproduce asexually by binary fission, fragmentation, or budding; unlike bacteria, no known species of Archaea form endospores.\\n\\nThe first observed archaea were extremophiles, living in extreme environments, such as hot springs and salt lakes with no other organisms. Improved molecular detection tools led to the discovery of archaea in almost every habitat, including soil, oceans, and marshlands. Archaea are particularly numerous in the oceans, and the archaea in plankton may be one of the most abundant groups of organisms on the planet.\\n\\nArchaea are a major part of Earth\\'s life. They are part of the microbiota of all organisms. In the human microbiome, they are important in the gut, mouth, and on the skin.[124] Their morphological, metabolic, and geographical diversity permits them to play multiple ecological roles: carbon fixation; nitrogen cycling; organic compound turnover; and maintaining microbial symbiotic and syntrophic communities, for example.[125]\\nEukaryotes\\nMain article: Eukaryote\\nEuglena, a single-celled eukaryote that can both move and photosynthesize\\n\\nEukaryotes are hypothesized to have split from archaea, which was followed by their endosymbioses with bacteria (or symbiogenesis) that gave rise to mitochondria and chloroplasts, both of which are now part of modern-day eukaryotic cells.[126] The major lineages of eukaryotes diversified in the Precambrian about 1.5 billion years ago and can be classified into eight major clades: alveolates, excavates, stramenopiles, plants, rhizarians, amoebozoans, fungi, and animals.[126] Five of these clades are collectively known as protists, which are mostly microscopic eukaryotic organisms that are not plants, fungi, or animals.[126] While it is likely that protists share a common ancestor (the last eukaryotic common ancestor),[127] protists by themselves do not constitute a separate clade as some protists may be more closely related to plants, fungi, or animals than they are to other protists. Like groupings such as algae, invertebrates, or protozoans, the protist grouping is not a formal taxonomic group but is used for convenience.[126][128] Most protists are unicellular; these are called microbial eukaryotes.[126]\\n\\nPlants are mainly multicellular organisms, predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae, which would exclude fungi and some algae. Plant cells were derived by endosymbiosis of a cyanobacterium into an early eukaryote about one billion years ago, which gave rise to chloroplasts.[129] The first several clades that emerged following primary endosymbiosis were aquatic and most of the aquatic photosynthetic eukaryotic organisms are collectively described as algae, which is a term of convenience as not all algae are closely related.[129] Algae comprise several distinct clades such as glaucophytes, which are microscopic freshwater algae that may have resembled in form to the early unicellular ancestor of Plantae.[129] Unlike glaucophytes, the other algal clades such as red and green algae are multicellular. Green algae comprise three major clades: chlorophytes, coleochaetophytes, and stoneworts.[129]\\n\\nFungi are eukaryotes that digest foods outside their bodies,[130] secreting digestive enzymes that break down large food molecules before absorbing them through their cell membranes. Many fungi are also saprobes, feeding on dead organic matter, making them important decomposers in ecological systems.[130]\\n\\nAnimals are multicellular eukaryotes. With few exceptions, animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen, are able to move, can reproduce sexually, and grow from a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic development. Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described—of which around 1 million are insects—but it has been estimated there are over 7 million animal species in total. They have complex interactions with each other and their environments, forming intricate food webs.[131]\\nViruses\\nMain article: Virus\\nBacteriophages attached to a bacterial cell wall\\n\\nViruses are submicroscopic infectious agents that replicate inside the cells of organisms.[132] Viruses infect all types of life forms, from animals and plants to microorganisms, including bacteria and archaea.[133][134] More than 6,000 virus species have been described in detail.[135] Viruses are found in almost every ecosystem on Earth and are the most numerous type of biological entity.[136][137]\\n\\nThe origins of viruses in the evolutionary history of life are unclear: some may have evolved from plasmids—pieces of DNA that can move between cells—while others may have evolved from bacteria. In evolution, viruses are an important means of horizontal gene transfer, which increases genetic diversity in a way analogous to sexual reproduction.[138] Because viruses possess some but not all characteristics of life, they have been described as \"organisms at the edge of life\",[139] and as self-replicators.[140]\\nEcology\\nMain article: Ecology\\n\\nEcology is the study of the distribution and abundance of life, the interaction between organisms and their environment.[141]\\nEcosystems\\nMain article: Ecosystem\\n\\nThe community of living (biotic) organisms in conjunction with the nonliving (abiotic) components (e.g., water, light, radiation, temperature, humidity, atmosphere, acidity, and soil) of their environment is called an ecosystem.[142][143][144] These biotic and abiotic components are linked together through nutrient cycles and energy flows.[145] Energy from the sun enters the system through photosynthesis and is incorporated into plant tissue. By feeding on plants and on one another, animals move matter and energy through the system. They also influence the quantity of plant and microbial biomass present. By breaking down dead organic matter, decomposers release carbon back to the atmosphere and facilitate nutrient cycling by converting nutrients stored in dead biomass back to a form that can be readily used by plants and other microbes.[146]\\nPopulations\\nMain article: Population ecology\\nReaching carrying capacity through a logistic growth curve\\n\\nA population is the group of organisms of the same species that occupies an area and reproduce from generation to generation.[147][148][149][150][151] Population size can be estimated by multiplying population density by the area or volume. The carrying capacity of an environment is the maximum population size of a species that can be sustained by that specific environment, given the food, habitat, water, and other resources that are available.[152] The carrying capacity of a population can be affected by changing environmental conditions such as changes in the availability resources and the cost of maintaining them. In human populations, new technologies such as the Green revolution have helped increase the Earth\\'s carrying capacity for humans over time, which has stymied the attempted predictions of impending population decline, the most famous of which was by Thomas Malthus in the 18th century.[147]\\nCommunities\\nMain article: Community (ecology)\\nA (a) trophic pyramid and a (b) simplified food web. The trophic pyramid represents the biomass at each level.[153]\\n\\nA community is a group of populations of species occupying the same geographical area at the same time. A biological interaction is the effect that a pair of organisms living together in a community have on each other. They can be either of the same species (intraspecific interactions), or of different species (interspecific interactions). These effects may be short-term, like pollination and predation, or long-term; both often strongly influence the evolution of the species involved. A long-term interaction is called a symbiosis. Symbioses range from mutualism, beneficial to both partners, to competition, harmful to both partners.[154] Every species participates as a consumer, resource, or both in consumer–resource interactions, which form the core of food chains or food webs.[155] There are different trophic levels within any food web, with the lowest level being the primary producers (or autotrophs) such as plants and algae that convert energy and inorganic material into organic compounds, which can then be used by the rest of the community.[51][156][157] At the next level are the heterotrophs, which are the species that obtain energy by breaking apart organic compounds from other organisms.[155] Heterotrophs that consume plants are primary consumers (or herbivores) whereas heterotrophs that consume herbivores are secondary consumers (or carnivores). And those that eat secondary consumers are tertiary consumers and so on. Omnivorous heterotrophs are able to consume at multiple levels. Finally, there are decomposers that feed on the waste products or dead bodies of organisms.[155] On average, the total amount of energy incorporated into the biomass of a trophic level per unit of time is about one-tenth of the energy of the trophic level that it consumes. Waste and dead material used by decomposers as well as heat lost from metabolism make up the other ninety percent of energy that is not consumed by the next trophic level.[158]\\nBiosphere\\nMain article: Biosphere\\nFast carbon cycle showing the movement of carbon between land, atmosphere, and oceans in billions of tons per year. Yellow numbers are natural fluxes, red are human contributions, white are stored carbon. Effects of the slow carbon cycle, such as volcanic and tectonic activity, are not included.[159]\\n\\nIn the global ecosystem or biosphere, matter exists as different interacting compartments, which can be biotic or abiotic as well as accessible or inaccessible, depending on their forms and locations.[160] For example, matter from terrestrial autotrophs are both biotic and accessible to other organisms whereas the matter in rocks and minerals are abiotic and inaccessible. A biogeochemical cycle is a pathway by which specific elements of matter are turned over or moved through the biotic (biosphere) and the abiotic (lithosphere, atmosphere, and hydrosphere) compartments of Earth. There are biogeochemical cycles for nitrogen, carbon, and water.\\nConservation\\nMain article: Conservation biology\\n\\nConservation biology is the study of the conservation of Earth\\'s biodiversity with the aim of protecting species, their habitats, and ecosystems from excessive rates of extinction and the erosion of biotic interactions.[161][162][163] It is concerned with factors that influence the maintenance, loss, and restoration of biodiversity and the science of sustaining evolutionary processes that engender genetic, population, species, and ecosystem diversity.[164][165][166][167] The concern stems from estimates suggesting that up to 50% of all species on the planet will disappear within the next 50 years,[168] which has contributed to poverty, starvation, and will reset the course of evolution on this planet.[169][170] Biodiversity affects the functioning of ecosystems, which provide a variety of services upon which people depend. Conservation biologists research and educate on the trends of biodiversity loss, species extinctions, and the negative effect these are having on our capabilities to sustain the well-being of human society. Organizations and citizens are responding to the current biodiversity crisis through conservation action plans that direct research, monitoring, and education programs that engage concerns at local through global scales.[171][164][165][166]\\nSee also\\n\\n    Biology in fiction\\n    Glossary of biology\\n    List of biological websites\\n    List of biologists\\n    List of biology journals\\n    List of biology topics\\n    List of life sciences\\n    List of omics topics in biology\\n    National Association of Biology Teachers\\n    Outline of biology\\n    Periodic table of life sciences in Tinbergen\\'s four questions\\n    Reproduction\\n    Science tourism\\n    Terminology of biology\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nUrry, Lisa; Cain, Michael; Wasserman, Steven; Minorsky, Peter; Reece, Jane (2017). \"Evolution, the themes of biology, and scientific inquiry\".

(when the number of atoms on either side is unequal, the transformation is referred to as a nuclear reaction or radioactive decay.) the type of chemical reactions a substance may undergo and the energy changes that may accompany it are constrained by certain basic rules, known as chemical laws.\\n\\nenergy and entropy considerations are invariably important in almost all chemical studies. chemical substances are classified in terms of their structure, phase, as well as their chemical compositions. they can be analyzed using the tools of chemical analysis, e.g. spectroscopy and chromatography. scientists engaged in chemical research are known as chemists.[14] most chemists specialize in one or more sub-disciplines. several concepts are essential for the study of chemistry; some of them are:[15]\\nmatter\\nmain article: matter\\n\\nin chemistry, matter is defined as anything that has rest mass and volume (it takes up space) and is made up of particles. the particles that make up matter have rest mass as well – not all particles have rest mass, such as the photon. matter can be a pure chemical substance or a mixture of substances.[16]\\natom\\nmain article: atom\\na diagram of an atom based on the bohr model\\n\\nthe atom is the basic unit of chemistry. it consists of a dense core called the atomic nucleus surrounded by a space occupied by an electron cloud. the nucleus is made up of positively charged protons and uncharged neutrons (together called nucleons), while the electron cloud consists of negatively charged electrons which orbit the nucleus. in a neutral atom, the negatively charged electrons balance out the positive charge of the protons. the nucleus is dense; the mass of a nucleon is approximately 1,836 times that of an electron, yet the radius of an atom is about 10,000 times that of its nucleus.[17][18]\\n\\nthe atom is also the smallest entity that can be envisaged to retain the chemical properties of the element, such as electronegativity, ionization potential, preferred oxidation state(s), coordination number, and preferred types of bonds to form (e.g., metallic, ionic, covalent).\\nelement\\nstandard form of the periodic table of chemical elements. the colors represent different blocks of elements\\nmain article: chemical element\\n\\na chemical element is a pure substance which is composed of a single type of atom, characterized by its particular number of protons in the nuclei of its atoms, known as the atomic number and represented by the symbol z. the mass number is the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in a nucleus. although all the nuclei of all atoms belonging to one element will have the same atomic number, they may not necessarily have the same mass number; atoms of an element which have different mass numbers are known as isotopes. for example, all atoms with 6 protons in their nuclei are atoms of the chemical element carbon, but atoms of carbon may have mass numbers of 12 or 13.[18]\\n\\nthe standard presentation of the chemical elements is in the periodic table, which orders elements by atomic number. the periodic table is arranged in groups, or columns, and periods, or rows. the periodic table is useful in identifying periodic trends.[19]\\ncompound\\ncarbon dioxide (co2), an example of a chemical compound\\nmain article: chemical compound\\n\\na compound is a pure chemical substance composed of more than one element. the properties of a compound bear little similarity to those of its elements.[20] the standard nomenclature of compounds is set by the international union of pure and applied chemistry (iupac). organic compounds are named according to the organic nomenclature system.[21] the names for inorganic compounds are created according to the inorganic nomenclature system. when a compound has more than one component, then they are divided into two classes, the electropositive and the electronegative components.[22] in addition the chemical abstracts service has devised a method to index chemical substances. in this scheme each chemical substance is identifiable by a number known as its cas registry number.\\nmolecule\\nmain article: molecule\\na ball-and-stick representation of the caffeine molecule (c8h10n4o2).\\n\\na molecule is the smallest indivisible portion of a pure chemical substance that has its unique set of chemical properties, that is, its potential to undergo a certain set of chemical reactions with other substances. however, this definition only works well for substances that are composed of molecules, which is not true of many substances (see below). molecules are typically a set of atoms bound together by covalent bonds, such that the structure is electrically neutral and all valence electrons are paired with other electrons either in bonds or in lone pairs.\\n\\nthus, molecules exist as electrically neutral units, unlike ions. when this rule is broken, giving the \"molecule\" a charge, the result is sometimes named a molecular ion or a polyatomic ion. however, the discrete and separate nature of the molecular concept usually requires that molecular ions be present only in well-separated form, such as a directed beam in a vacuum in a mass spectrometer. charged polyatomic collections residing in solids (for example, common sulfate or nitrate ions) are generally not considered \"molecules\" in chemistry. some molecules contain one or more unpaired electrons, creating radicals. most radicals are comparatively reactive, but some, such as nitric oxide (no) can be stable.\\na 2-d structural formula of a benzene molecule (c6h6)\\n\\nthe \"inert\" or noble gas elements (helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon and radon) are composed of lone atoms as their smallest discrete unit, but the other isolated chemical elements consist of either molecules or networks of atoms bonded to each other in some way. identifiable molecules compose familiar substances such as water, air, and many organic compounds like alcohol, sugar, gasoline, and the various pharmaceuticals.\\n\\nhowever, not all substances or chemical compounds consist of discrete molecules, and indeed most of the solid substances that make up the solid crust, mantle, and core of the earth are chemical compounds without molecules. these other types of substances, such as ionic compounds and network solids, are organized in such a way as to lack the existence of identifiable molecules per se. instead, these substances are discussed in terms of formula units or unit cells as the smallest repeating structure within the substance. examples of such substances are mineral salts (such as table salt), solids like carbon and diamond, metals, and familiar silica and silicate minerals such as quartz and granite.\\n\\none of the main characteristics of a molecule is its geometry often called its structure. while the structure of diatomic, triatomic or tetra-atomic molecules may be trivial, (linear, angular pyramidal etc.) the structure of polyatomic molecules, that are constituted of more than six atoms (of several elements) can be crucial for its chemical nature.\\nsubstance and mixture\\ncín.png sulfur-sample.jpg\\ndiamants maclés 2(république d\\'afrique du sud).jpg sugar 2xmacro.jpg\\nsal (close).jpg sodium bicarbonate.jpg\\nexamples of pure chemical substances. from left to right: the elements tin (sn) and sulfur (s), diamond (an allotrope of carbon), sucrose (pure sugar), and sodium chloride (salt) and sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), which are both ionic compounds.\\n\\na chemical substance is a kind of matter with a definite composition and set of properties.[23] a collection of substances is called a mixture. examples of mixtures are air and alloys.[24]\\nmole and amount of substance\\nmain article: mole\\n\\nthe mole is a unit of measurement that denotes an amount of substance (also called chemical amount). one mole is defined to contain exactly 6.02214076×1023 particles (atoms, molecules, ions, or electrons), where the number of particles per mole is known as the avogadro constant.[25] molar concentration is the amount of a particular substance per volume of solution, and is commonly reported in mol/dm3.[26]\\nphase\\ndiagram showing relationships among the phases and the terms used to describe phase changes.\\nmain article: phase\\n\\nin addition to the specific chemical properties that distinguish different chemical classifications, chemicals can exist in several phases. for the most part, the chemical classifications are independent of these bulk phase classifications; however, some more exotic phases are incompatible with certain chemical properties. a phase is a set of states of a chemical system that have similar bulk structural properties, over a range of conditions, such as pressure or temperature.\\n\\nphysical properties, such as density and refractive index tend to fall within values characteristic of the phase. the phase of matter is defined by the phase transition, which is when energy put into or taken out of the system goes into rearranging the structure of the system, instead of changing the bulk conditions.\\n\\nsometimes the distinction between phases can be continuous instead of having a discrete boundary\\' in this case the matter is considered to be in a supercritical state. when three states meet based on the conditions, it is known as a triple point and since this is invariant, it is a convenient way to define a set of conditions.\\n\\nthe most familiar examples of phases are solids, liquids, and gases. many substances exhibit multiple solid phases. for example, there are three phases of solid iron (alpha, gamma, and delta) that vary based on temperature and pressure. a principal difference between solid phases is the crystal structure, or arrangement, of the atoms. another phase commonly encountered in the study of chemistry is the aqueous phase, which is the state of substances dissolved in aqueous solution (that is, in water).\\n\\nless familiar phases include plasmas, bose–einstein condensates and fermionic condensates and the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases of magnetic materials. while most familiar phases deal with three-dimensional systems, it is also possible to define analogs in two-dimensional systems, which has received attention for its relevance to systems in biology.\\nbonding\\nmain article: chemical bond\\nan animation of the process of ionic bonding between sodium (na) and chlorine (cl) to form sodium chloride, or common table salt. ionic bonding involves one atom taking valence electrons from another (as opposed to sharing, which occurs in covalent bonding)\\n\\natoms sticking together in molecules or crystals are said to be bonded with one another. a chemical bond may be visualized as the multipole balance between the positive charges in the nuclei and the negative charges oscillating about them.[27] more than simple attraction and repulsion, the energies and distributions characterize the availability of an electron to bond to another atom.\\n\\nthe chemical bond can be a covalent bond, an ionic bond, a hydrogen bond or just because of van der waals force. each of these kinds of bonds is ascribed to some potential. these potentials create the interactions[disambiguation needed] which hold atoms together in molecules or crystals. in many simple compounds, valence bond theory, the valence shell electron pair repulsion model (vsepr), and the concept of oxidation number can be used to explain molecular structure and composition.\\n\\nan ionic bond is formed when a metal loses one or more of its electrons, becoming a positively charged cation, and the electrons are then gained by the non-metal atom, becoming a negatively charged anion. the two oppositely charged ions attract one another, and the ionic bond is the electrostatic force of attraction between them. for example, sodium (na), a metal, loses one electron to become an na+ cation while chlorine (cl), a non-metal, gains this electron to become cl−. the ions are held together due to electrostatic attraction, and that compound sodium chloride (nacl), or common table salt, is formed.\\nin the methane molecule (ch4), the carbon atom shares a pair of valence electrons with each of the four hydrogen atoms. thus, the octet rule is satisfied for c-atom (it has eight electrons in its valence shell) and the duet rule is satisfied for the h-atoms (they have two electrons in their valence shells).\\n\\nin a covalent bond, one or more pairs of valence electrons are shared by two atoms: the resulting electrically neutral group of bonded atoms is termed a molecule. atoms will share valence electrons in such a way as to create a noble gas electron configuration (eight electrons in their outermost shell) for each atom. atoms that tend to combine in such a way that they each have eight electrons in their valence shell are said to follow the octet rule. however, some elements like hydrogen and lithium need only two electrons in their outermost shell to attain this stable configuration; these atoms are said to follow the duet rule, and in this way they are reaching the electron configuration of the noble gas helium, which has two electrons in its outer shell.\\n\\nsimilarly, theories from classical physics can be used to predict many ionic structures. with more complicated compounds, such as metal complexes, valence bond theory is less applicable and alternative approaches, such as the molecular orbital theory, are generally used. see diagram on electronic orbitals.\\nenergy\\nmain article: energy\\n\\nin the context of chemistry, energy is an attribute of a substance as a consequence of its atomic, molecular or aggregate structure. since a chemical transformation is accompanied by a change in one or more of these kinds of structures, it is invariably accompanied by an increase or decrease of energy of the substances involved. some energy is transferred between the surroundings and the reactants of the reaction in the form of heat or light; thus the products of a reaction may have more or less energy than the reactants.\\n\\na reaction is said to be exergonic if the final state is lower on the energy scale than the initial state; in the case of endergonic reactions the situation is the reverse. a reaction is said to be exothermic if the reaction releases heat to the surroundings; in the case of endothermic reactions, the reaction absorbs heat from the surroundings.\\n\\nchemical reactions are invariably not possible unless the reactants surmount an energy barrier known as the activation energy. the speed of a chemical reaction (at given temperature t) is related to the activation energy e, by the boltzmann\\'s population factor e − e / k t e^{-e/kt} – that is the probability of a molecule to have energy greater than or equal to e at the given temperature t. this exponential dependence of a reaction rate on temperature is known as the arrhenius equation. the activation energy necessary for a chemical reaction to occur can be in the form of heat, light, electricity or mechanical force in the form of ultrasound.[28]\\n\\na related concept free energy, which also incorporates entropy considerations, is a very useful means for predicting the feasibility of a reaction and determining the state of equilibrium of a chemical reaction, in chemical thermodynamics. a reaction is feasible only if the total change in the gibbs free energy is negative, δ g ≤ 0 \\\\delta g \\\\le 0 \\\\,; if it is equal to zero the chemical reaction is said to be at equilibrium.\\n\\nthere exist only limited possible states of energy for electrons, atoms and molecules. these are determined by the rules of quantum mechanics, which require quantization of energy of a bound system. the atoms/molecules in a higher energy state are said to be excited. the molecules/atoms of substance in an excited energy state are often much more reactive; that is, more amenable to chemical reactions.\\n\\nthe phase of a substance is invariably determined by its energy and the energy of its surroundings. when the intermolecular forces of a substance are such that the energy of the surroundings is not sufficient to overcome them, it occurs in a more ordered phase like liquid or solid as is the case with water (h2o); a liquid at room temperature because its molecules are bound by hydrogen bonds.[29] whereas hydrogen sulfide (h2s) is a gas at room temperature and standard pressure, as its molecules are bound by weaker dipole-dipole interactions.\\n\\nthe transfer of energy from one chemical substance to another depends on the size of energy quanta emitted from one substance. however, heat energy is often transferred more easily from almost any substance to another because the phonons responsible for vibrational and rotational energy levels in a substance have much less energy than photons invoked for the electronic energy transfer. thus, because vibrational and rotational energy levels are more closely spaced than electronic energy levels, heat is more easily transferred between substances relative to light or other forms of electronic energy. for example, ultraviolet electromagnetic radiation is not transferred with as much efficacy from one substance to another as thermal or electrical energy.\\n\\nthe existence of characteristic energy levels for different chemical substances is useful for their identification by the analysis of spectral lines. different kinds of spectra are often used in chemical spectroscopy, e.g. ir, microwave, nmr, esr, etc. spectroscopy is also used to identify the composition of remote objects – like stars and distant galaxies – by analyzing their radiation spectra.\\nemission spectrum of iron\\n\\nthe term chemical energy is often used to indicate the potential of a chemical substance to undergo a transformation through a chemical reaction or to transform other chemical substances.\\nreaction\\nmain article: chemical reaction\\nduring chemical reactions, bonds between atoms break and form, resulting in different substances with different properties. in a blast furnace, iron oxide, a compound, reacts with carbon monoxide to form iron, one of the chemical elements, and carbon dioxide.\\n\\nwhen a chemical substance is transformed as a result of its interaction with another substance or with energy, a chemical reaction is said to have occurred. a chemical reaction is therefore a concept related to the \"reaction\" of a substance when it comes in close contact with another, whether as a mixture or a solution; exposure to some form of energy, or both. it results in some energy exchange between the constituents of the reaction as well as with the system environment, which may be designed vessels—often laboratory glassware.\\n\\nchemical reactions can result in the formation or dissociation of molecules, that is, molecules breaking apart to form two or more molecules or rearrangement of atoms within or across molecules. chemical reactions usually involve the making or breaking of chemical bonds. oxidation, reduction, dissociation, acid–base neutralization and molecular rearrangement are some examples of common chemical reactions.\\n\\na chemical reaction can be symbolically depicted through a chemical equation. while in a non-nuclear chemical reaction the number and kind of atoms on both sides of the equation are equal, for a nuclear reaction this holds true only for the nuclear particles viz. protons and neutrons.[30]\\n\\nthe sequence of steps in which the reorganization of chemical bonds may be taking place in the course of a chemical reaction is called its mechanism. a chemical reaction can be envisioned to take place in a number of steps, each of which may have a different speed. many reaction intermediates with variable stability can thus be envisaged during the course of a reaction. reaction mechanisms are proposed to explain the kinetics and the relative product mix of a reaction. many physical chemists specialize in exploring and proposing the mechanisms of various chemical reactions. several empirical rules, like the woodward–hoffmann rules often come in handy while proposing a mechanism for a chemical reaction.\\n\\naccording to the iupac gold book, a chemical reaction is \"a process that results in the interconversion of chemical species.\"[31] accordingly, a chemical reaction may be an elementary reaction or a stepwise reaction. an additional caveat is made, in that this definition includes cases where the interconversion of conformers is experimentally observable. such detectable chemical reactions normally involve sets of molecular entities as indicated by this definition, but it is often conceptually convenient to use the term also for changes involving single molecular entities (i.e. \\'microscopic chemical events\\').\\nions and salts\\nthe crystal lattice structure of potassium chloride (kcl), a salt which is formed due to the attraction of k+ cations and cl− anions. note how the overall charge of the ionic compound is zero.\\nmain article: ion\\n\\nan ion is a charged species, an atom or a molecule, that has lost or gained one or more electrons. when an atom loses an electron and thus has more protons than electrons, the atom is a positively charged ion or cation. when an atom gains an electron and thus has more electrons than protons, the atom is a negatively charged ion or anion. cations and anions can form a crystalline lattice of neutral salts, such as the na+ and cl− ions forming sodium chloride, or nacl. examples of polyatomic ions that do not split up during acid–base reactions are hydroxide (oh−) and phosphate (po43−).\\n\\nplasma is composed of gaseous matter that has been completely ionized, usually through high temperature.\\nacidity and basicity\\nhydrogen bromide exists in the gas phase as a diatomic molecule\\nmain article: acid–base reaction\\n\\na substance can often be classified as an acid or a base. there are several different theories which explain acid–base behavior. the simplest is arrhenius theory, which states that acid is a substance that produces hydronium ions when it is dissolved in water, and a base is one that produces hydroxide ions when dissolved in water. according to brønsted–lowry acid–base theory, acids are substances that donate a positive hydrogen ion to another substance in a chemical reaction; by extension, a base is the substance which receives that hydrogen ion.\\n\\na third common theory is lewis acid–base theory, which is based on the formation of new chemical bonds. lewis theory explains that an acid is a substance which is capable of accepting a pair of electrons from another substance during the process of bond formation, while a base is a substance which can provide a pair of electrons to form a new bond. there are several other ways in which a substance may be classified as an acid or a base, as is evident in the history of this concept.[32]\\n\\nacid strength is commonly measured by two methods. one measurement, based on the arrhenius definition of acidity, is ph, which is a measurement of the hydronium ion concentration in a solution, as expressed on a negative logarithmic scale. thus, solutions that have a low ph have a high hydronium ion concentration and can be said to be more acidic. the other measurement, based on the brønsted–lowry definition, is the acid dissociation constant (ka), which measures the relative ability of a substance to act as an acid under the brønsted–lowry definition of an acid. that is, substances with a higher ka are more likely to donate hydrogen ions in chemical reactions than those with lower ka values.\\nredox\\nmain article: redox\\n\\nredox (reduction-oxidation) reactions include all chemical reactions in which atoms have their oxidation state changed by either gaining electrons (reduction) or losing electrons (oxidation). substances that have the ability to oxidize other substances are said to be oxidative and are known as oxidizing agents, oxidants or oxidizers. an oxidant removes electrons from another substance. similarly, substances that have the ability to reduce other substances are said to be reductive and are known as reducing agents, reductants, or reducers.\\n\\na reductant transfers electrons to another substance and is thus oxidized itself. and because it \"donates\" electrons it is also called an electron donor. oxidation and reduction properly refer to a change in oxidation number—the actual transfer of electrons may never occur. thus, oxidation is better defined as an increase in oxidation number, and reduction as a decrease in oxidation number.\\nequilibrium\\nmain article: chemical equilibrium\\n\\nalthough the concept of equilibrium is widely used across sciences, in the context of chemistry, it arises whenever a number of different states of the chemical composition are possible, as for example, in a mixture of several chemical compounds that can react with one another, or when a substance can be present in more than one kind of phase.\\n\\na system of chemical substances at equilibrium, even though having an unchanging composition, is most often not static; molecules of the substances continue to react with one another thus giving rise to a dynamic equilibrium. thus the concept describes the state in which the parameters such as chemical composition remain unchanged over time.\\nchemical laws\\nmain article: chemical law\\n\\nchemical reactions are governed by certain laws, which have become fundamental concepts in chemistry. some of them are:\\n\\n    avogadro\\'s law\\n    beer–lambert law\\n    boyle\\'s law (1662, relating pressure and volume)\\n    charles\\'s law (1787, relating volume and temperature)\\n    fick\\'s laws of diffusion\\n    gay-lussac\\'s law (1809, relating pressure and temperature)\\n    le chatelier\\'s principle\\n    henry\\'s law\\n    hess\\'s law\\n    law of conservation of energy leads to the important concepts of equilibrium, thermodynamics, and kinetics.\\n    law of conservation of mass continues to be conserved in isolated systems, even in modern physics. however, special relativity shows that due to mass–energy equivalence, whenever non-material \"energy\" (heat, light, kinetic energy) is removed from a non-isolated system, some mass will be lost with it. high energy losses result in loss of weighable amounts of mass, an important topic in nuclear chemistry.\\n    law of definite composition, although in many systems (notably biomacromolecules and minerals) the ratios tend to require large numbers, and are frequently represented as a fraction.\\n    law of multiple proportions\\n    raoult\\'s law\\n\\nhistory\\nmain article: history of chemistry\\n\\nthe history of chemistry spans a period from very old times to the present. since several millennia bc, civilizations were using technologies that would eventually form the basis of the various branches of chemistry. examples include extracting metals from ores, making pottery and glazes, fermenting beer and wine, extracting chemicals from plants for medicine and perfume, rendering fat into soap, making glass, and making alloys like bronze.\\n\\nchemistry was preceded by its protoscience, alchemy, which operated a non-scientific approach to understanding the constituents of matter and their interactions. despite being unsuccessful in explaining the nature of matter and its transformations, alchemists set the stage for modern chemistry by performing experiments and recording the results. robert boyle, although skeptical of elements and convinced of alchemy, played a key part in elevating the \"sacred art\" as an independent, fundamental and philosophical discipline in his work the sceptical chymist (1661).[33]\\n\\nwhile both alchemy and chemistry are concerned with matter and its transformations, the crucial difference was given by the scientific method that chemists employed in their work. chemistry, as a body of knowledge distinct from alchemy, became an established science with the work of antoine lavoisier, who developed a law of conservation of mass that demanded careful measurement and quantitative observations of chemical phenomena. the history of chemistry afterwards is intertwined with the history of thermodynamics, especially through the work of willard gibbs.[34]\\ndefinition\\n\\nthe definition of chemistry has changed over time, as new discoveries and theories add to the functionality of the science. the term \"chymistry\", in the view of noted scientist robert boyle in 1661, meant the subject of the material principles of mixed bodies.[35] in 1663, the chemist christopher glaser described \"chymistry\" as a scientific art, by which one learns to dissolve bodies, and draw from them the different substances on their composition, and how to unite them again, and exalt them to a higher perfection.[36]\\n\\nthe 1730 definition of the word \"chemistry\", as used by georg ernst stahl, meant the art of resolving mixed, compound, or aggregate bodies into their principles; and of composing such bodies from those principles.[37] in 1837, jean-baptiste dumas considered the word \"chemistry\" to refer to the science concerned with the laws and effects of molecular forces.[38] this definition further evolved until, in 1947, it came to mean the science of substances: their structure, their properties, and the reactions that change them into other substances – a characterization accepted by linus pauling.[39] more recently, in 1998, professor raymond chang broadened the definition of \"chemistry\" to mean the study of matter and the changes it undergoes.[40]\\nbackground\\nmain article: history of chemistry\\nsee also: alchemy and timeline of chemistry\\ndemocritus\\' atomist philosophy was later adopted by epicurus (341–270 bce).\\n\\nearly civilizations, such as the egyptians[41] babylonians and indians[42] amassed practical knowledge concerning the arts of metallurgy, pottery and dyes, but didn\\'t develop a systematic theory.\\n\\na basic chemical hypothesis first emerged in classical greece with the theory of four elements as propounded definitively by aristotle stating that fire, air, earth and water were the fundamental elements from which everything is formed as a combination. greek atomism dates back to 440 bc, arising in works by philosophers such as democritus and epicurus. in 50 bce, the roman philosopher lucretius expanded upon the theory in his book de rerum natura (on the nature of things).[43][44] unlike modern concepts of science, greek atomism was purely philosophical in nature, with little concern for empirical observations and no concern for chemical experiments.[45]\\n\\nan early form of the idea of conservation of mass is the notion that \"nothing comes from nothing\" in ancient greek philosophy, which can be found in empedocles (approx. 4th century bc): \"for it is impossible for anything to come to be from what is not, and it cannot be brought about or heard of that what is should be utterly destroyed.\"[46] and epicurus (3rd century bc), who, describing the nature of the universe, wrote that \"the totality of things was always such as it is now, and always will be\".[47]\\n15th-century artistic impression of jābir ibn hayyān (geber), a perso-arab alchemist and pioneer in organic chemistry.\\n\\nin the hellenistic world the art of alchemy first proliferated, mingling magic and occultism into the study of natural substances with the ultimate goal of transmuting elements into gold and discovering the elixir of eternal life.[48] work, particularly the development of distillation, continued in the early byzantine period with the most famous practitioner being the 4th century greek-egyptian zosimos of panopolis.[49] alchemy continued to be developed and practised throughout the arab world after the muslim conquests,[50] and from there, and from the byzantine remnants,[51] diffused into medieval and renaissance europe through latin translations.\\n\\nthe arabic works attributed to jabir ibn hayyan introduced a systematic classification of chemical substances, and provided instructions for deriving an inorganic compound (sal ammoniac or ammonium chloride) from organic substances (such as plants, blood, and hair) by chemical means.[52] some arabic jabirian works (e.g., the \"book of mercy\", and the \"book of seventy\") were later translated into latin under the latinized name \"geber\",[53] and in 13th-century europe an anonymous writer, usually referred to as pseudo-geber, started to produce alchemical and metallurgical writings under this name.[54] later influential muslim philosophers, such as abū al-rayhān al-bīrūnī[55] and avicenna[56] disputed the theories of alchemy, particularly the theory of the transmutation of metals.\\n\\nunder the influence of the new empirical methods propounded by sir francis bacon and others, a group of chemists at oxford, robert boyle, robert hooke and john mayow began to reshape the old alchemical traditions into a scientific discipline. boyle in particular questioned some commonly held chemical theories and argued for chemical practitioners to be more \"philosophical\" and less commercially focused in the sceptical chemyst.[33] he formulated boyle\\'s law, rejected the classical \"four elements\" and proposed a mechanistic alternative of atoms and chemical reactions that could be subject to rigorous experiment.[57]\\nantoine-laurent de lavoisier is considered the \"father of modern chemistry\".[58]\\n\\nin the following decades, many important discoveries were made, such as the nature of \\'air\\' which was discovered to be composed of many different gases. the scottish chemist joseph black and the flemish jan baptist van helmont discovered carbon dioxide, or what black called \\'fixed air\\' in 1754; henry cavendish discovered hydrogen and elucidated its properties and joseph priestley and, independently, carl wilhelm scheele isolated pure oxygen. the theory of phlogiston (a substance at the root of all combustion) was propounded by the german georg ernst stahl in the early 18th century and was only overturned by the end of the century by the french chemist antoine lavoisier, the chemical analogue of newton in physics. lavoisier did more than any other to establish the new science on proper theoretical footing, by elucidating the principle of conservation of mass and developing a new system of chemical nomenclature used to this day.[59]\\n\\nenglish scientist john dalton proposed the modern theory of atoms; that all substances are composed of indivisible \\'atoms\\' of matter and that different atoms have varying atomic weights.\\n\\nthe development of the electrochemical theory of chemical combinations occurred in the early 19th century as the result of the work of two scientists in particular, jöns jacob berzelius and humphry davy, made possible by the prior invention of the voltaic pile by alessandro volta. davy discovered nine new elements including the alkali metals by extracting them from their oxides with electric current.[60]\\nin his periodic table, dmitri mendeleev predicted the existence of 7 new elements,[61] and placed all 60 elements known at the time in their correct places.[62]\\n\\nbritish william prout first proposed ordering all the elements by their atomic weight as all atoms had a weight that was an exact multiple of the atomic weight of hydrogen. j.a.r. newlands devised an early table of elements, which was then developed into the modern periodic table of elements[63] in the 1860s by dmitri mendeleev and independently by several other scientists including julius lothar meyer.[64][65] the inert gases, later called the noble gases were discovered by william ramsay in collaboration with lord rayleigh at the end of the century, thereby filling in the basic structure of the table.\\ntop: expected results: alpha particles passing through the plum pudding model of the atom undisturbed.\\nbottom: observed results: a small portion of the particles were deflected, indicating a small, concentrated charge.\\n\\nat the turn of the twentieth century the theoretical underpinnings of chemistry were finally understood due to a series of remarkable discoveries that succeeded in probing and discovering the very nature of the internal structure of atoms. in 1897, j.j. thomson of the university of cambridge discovered the electron and soon after the french scientist becquerel as well as the couple pierre and marie curie investigated the phenomenon of radioactivity. in a series of pioneering scattering experiments ernest rutherford at the university of manchester discovered the internal structure of the atom and the existence of the proton, classified and explained the different types of radioactivity and successfully transmuted the first element by bombarding nitrogen with alpha particles.\\n\\nhis work on atomic structure was improved on by his students, the danish physicist niels bohr, the englishman henry moseley and the german otto hahn, who went on to father the emerging nuclear chemistry and discovered nuclear fission. the electronic theory of chemical bonds and molecular orbitals was developed by the american scientists linus pauling and gilbert n. lewis.\\n\\nthe year 2011 was declared by the united nations as the international year of chemistry.[66] it was an initiative of the international union of pure and applied chemistry, and of the united nations educational, scientific, and cultural organization and involves chemical societies, academics, and institutions worldwide and relied on individual initiatives to organize local and regional activities.\\n\\norganic chemistry was developed by justus von liebig and others, following friedrich wöhler\\'s synthesis of urea.[67] other crucial 19th century advances were; an understanding of valence bonding (edward frankland in 1852) and the application of thermodynamics to chemistry (j. w. gibbs and svante arrhenius in the 1870s).\\npractice\\nsubdisciplines\\nsee also: outline of chemistry § branches of chemistry\\nquestion book-new.svg\\n\\t\\nthis article relies largely or entirely

newspapers · books · scholar · jstor (september 2014)\\n\\nchemistry is typically divided into several major sub-disciplines. there are also several main cross-disciplinary and more specialized fields of chemistry.[68]\\n\\n    analytical chemistry is the analysis of material samples to gain an understanding of their chemical composition and structure. analytical chemistry incorporates standardized experimental methods in chemistry. these methods may be used in all subdisciplines of chemistry, excluding purely theoretical chemistry.\\n    biochemistry is the study of the chemicals, chemical reactions and interaction[disambiguation needed]s that take place in living organisms. biochemistry and organic chemistry are closely related, as in medicinal chemistry or neurochemistry. biochemistry is also associated with molecular biology and genetics.\\n    inorganic chemistry is the study of the properties and reactions of inorganic compounds. the distinction between organic and inorganic disciplines is not absolute and there is much overlap, most importantly in the sub-discipline of organometallic chemistry.\\n    materials chemistry is the preparation, characterization, and understanding of substances with a useful function. the field is a new breadth of study in graduate programs, and it integrates elements from all classical areas of chemistry with a focus on fundamental issues that are unique to materials. primary systems of study include the chemistry of condensed phases (solids, liquids, polymers) and interfaces between different phases.\\n    neurochemistry is the study of neurochemicals; including transmitters, peptides, proteins, lipids, sugars, and nucleic acids; their interactions, and the roles they play in forming, maintaining, and modifying the nervous system.\\n    nuclear chemistry is the study of how subatomic particles come together and make nuclei. modern transmutation is a large component of nuclear chemistry, and the table of nuclides is an important result and tool for this field.\\n    organic chemistry is the study of the structure, properties, composition, mechanisms, and reactions of organic compounds. an organic compound is defined as any compound based on a carbon skeleton.\\n    physical chemistry is the study of the physical and fundamental basis of chemical systems and processes. in particular, the energetics and dynamics of such systems and processes are of interest to physical chemists. important areas of study include chemical thermodynamics, chemical kinetics, electrochemistry, statistical mechanics, spectroscopy, and more recently, astrochemistry.[69] physical chemistry has large overlap with molecular physics. physical chemistry involves the use of infinitesimal calculus in deriving equations. it is usually associated with quantum chemistry and theoretical chemistry. physical chemistry is a distinct discipline from chemical physics, but again, there is very strong overlap.\\n    theoretical chemistry is the study of chemistry via fundamental theoretical reasoning (usually within mathematics or physics). in particular the application of quantum mechanics to chemistry is called quantum chemistry. since the end of the second world war, the development of computers has allowed a systematic development of computational chemistry, which is the art of developing and applying computer programs for solving chemical problems. theoretical chemistry has large overlap with (theoretical and experimental) condensed matter physics and molecular physics.\\n\\nothers subdivisions include electrochemistry, femtochemistry, flavor chemistry, flow chemistry, immunohistochemistry, hydrogenation chemistry, mathematical chemistry, molecular mechanics, natural product chemistry, organometallic chemistry, petrochemistry, photochemistry, physical organic chemistry, polymer chemistry, radiochemistry, sonochemistry, supramolecular chemistry, synthetic chemistry, and many others.\\ninterdisciplinary\\n\\ninterdisciplinary fields include agrochemistry, astrochemistry (and cosmochemistry), atmospheric chemistry, chemical engineering, chemical biology, chemo-informatics, environmental chemistry, geochemistry, green chemistry, immunochemistry, marine chemistry, materials science, mechanochemistry, medicinal chemistry, molecular biology, nanotechnology, oenology, pharmacology, phytochemistry, solid-state chemistry, surface science, thermochemistry, and many others.\\nindustry\\nmain article: chemical industry\\n\\nthe

and advances in mechanics inspired the development of calculus.\\nhistory\\nmain article: history of physics\\n\\nthe word \"physics\" comes from ancient greek: φυσική (ἐπιστήμη), romanized: physikḗ (epistḗmē), meaning \"knowledge of nature\".[8][9][10]\\nancient astronomy\\nmain article: history of astronomy\\nancient egyptian astronomy is evident in monuments like the ceiling of senemut\\'s tomb from the eighteenth dynasty of egypt.\\n\\nastronomy is one of the oldest natural sciences. early civilizations dating back before 3000 bce, such as the sumerians, ancient egyptians, and the indus valley civilisation, had a predictive knowledge and a basic awareness of the motions of the sun, moon, and stars. the stars and planets, believed to represent gods, were often worshipped. while the explanations for the observed positions of the stars were often unscientific and lacking in evidence, these early observations laid the foundation for later astronomy, as the stars were found to traverse great circles across the sky,[6] which could not explain the positions of the planets.\\n\\naccording to asger aaboe, the origins of western astronomy can be found in mesopotamia, and all western efforts in the exact sciences are descended from late babylonian astronomy.[11] egyptian astronomers left monuments showing knowledge of the constellations and the motions of the celestial bodies,[12] while greek poet homer wrote of various celestial objects in his iliad and odyssey; later greek astronomers provided names, which are still used today, for most constellations visible from the northern hemisphere.[13]\\nnatural philosophy\\nmain article: natural philosophy\\n\\nnatural philosophy has its origins in greece during the archaic period (650 bce – 480 bce), when pre-socratic philosophers like thales rejected non-naturalistic explanations for natural phenomena and proclaimed that every event had a natural cause.[14] they proposed ideas verified by reason and observation, and many of their hypotheses proved successful in experiment;[15] for example, atomism was found to be correct approximately 2000 years after it was proposed by leucippus and his pupil democritus.[16]\\nmedieval european and islamic\\nmain articles: european science in the middle ages and physics in the medieval islamic world\\n\\nthe western roman empire fell in the fifth century, and this resulted in a decline in intellectual pursuits in the western part of europe. by contrast, the eastern roman empire (also known as the byzantine empire) resisted the attacks from the barbarians, and continued to advance various fields of learning, including physics.[17]\\n\\nin the sixth century, isidore of miletus created an important compilation of archimedes\\' works that are copied in the archimedes palimpsest.\\nibn al-haytham (alhazen) drawing\\nibn al-haytham (c. 965–c. 1040), book of optics book i, [6.85], [6.86]. book ii, [3.80] describes his camera obscura experiments.[18]\\n\\nin sixth-century europe john philoponus, a byzantine scholar, questioned aristotle\\'s teaching of physics and noted its flaws. he introduced the theory of impetus. aristotle\\'s physics was not scrutinized until philoponus appeared; unlike aristotle, who based his physics on verbal argument, philoponus relied on observation. on aristotle\\'s physics philoponus wrote:\\n\\n    but this is completely erroneous, and our view may be corroborated by actual observation more effectively than by any sort of verbal argument. for if you let fall from the same height two weights of which one is many times as heavy as the other, you will see that the ratio of the times required for the motion does not depend on the ratio of the weights, but that the difference in time is a very small one. and so, if the difference in the weights is not considerable, that is, of one is, let us say, double the other, there will be no difference, or else an imperceptible difference, in time, though the difference in weight is by no means negligible, with one body weighing twice as much as the other[19]\\n\\nphiloponus\\' criticism of aristotelian principles of physics served as an inspiration for galileo galilei ten centuries later,[20] during the scientific revolution. galileo cited philoponus substantially in his works when arguing that aristotelian physics was flawed.[21][22] in the 1300s jean buridan, a teacher in the faculty of arts at the university of paris, developed the concept of impetus. it was a step toward the modern ideas of inertia and momentum.[23]\\n\\nislamic scholarship inherited aristotelian physics from the greeks and during the islamic golden age developed it further, especially placing emphasis on observation and a priori reasoning, developing early forms of the scientific method.\\n\\nalthough aristotle’s principles of physics was criticized, it is important to identify his the evidence he based his views off of.  when thinking of the history of science and math, it is notable to acknowledge the contributions made by older scientists. aristotle’s science was the backbone of the science we learn in schools today. aristotle published many biological works including the parts of animals, in which he discusses both biological science and natural science as well. it is also integral to mention the role aristotle had in the progression of physics and metaphysics and how his beliefs and findings are still being taught in science classes to this day. the explanations that aristotle gives for his findings are also very simple. when thinking of the elements, aristotle believed that each element (earth, fire, water, air) had its own natural place. meaning that because of the density of these elements, they will revert back to their own specific place in the atmosphere.[24] so, because of their weights, fire would be at the very top, air right underneath fire, then water, then lastly earth. he also stated that when a small amount of one element enters the natural place of another, the less abundant element will automatically go into its own natural place. for example, if there is a fire on the ground, if you pay attention, the flames go straight up into the air as an attempt to go back into its natural place where it belongs. aristotle called his metaphysics “first philosophy” and characterized it as the study of “being as being”.[25] aristotle defined the paradigm of motion as a being or entity encompassing different areas in the same body. [25]meaning that if a person is at a certain location (a) they can move to a new location (b) and still take up the same amount of space. this is involved with aristotle’s belief that motion is a continuum. in terms of matter, aristotle believed that the change in category (ex. place) and quality (ex. color) of an object is defined as “alteration”. but, a change in substance is a change in matter. this is also very close to our idea of matter today.\\n\\nhe also devised his own laws of motion that include 1) heavier objects will fall faster, the speed being proportional to the weight and 2) the speed of the object that is falling depends inversely on the density object it is falling through (ex. density of air).[26] he also stated that, when it comes to violent motion (motion of an object when a force is applied to it by a second object) that the speed that object moves, will only be as fast or strong as the measure of force applied to it.[26] this is also seen in the rules of velocity and force that is taught in physics classes today. these rules are not necessarily what we see in our physics today but, they are very similar. it is evident that these rules were the backbone for other scientists to come revise and edit his beliefs.\\nthe basic way a pinhole camera works\\n\\nthe most notable innovations were in the field of optics and vision, which came from the works of many scientists like ibn sahl, al-kindi, ibn al-haytham, al-farisi and avicenna. the most notable work was the book of optics (also known as kitāb al-manāẓir), written by ibn al-haytham, in which he conclusively disproved the ancient greek idea about vision and came up with a new theory. in the book, he presented a study of the phenomenon of the camera obscura (his thousand-year-old version of the pinhole camera) and delved further into the way the eye itself works. using dissections and the knowledge of previous scholars, he was able to begin to explain how light enters the eye. he asserted that the light ray is focused, but the actual explanation of how light projected to the back of the eye had to wait until 1604. his treatise on light explained the camera obscura, hundreds of years before the modern development of photography.[27]\\n\\nthe seven-volume book of optics (kitab al-manathir) hugely influenced thinking across disciplines from the theory of visual perception to the nature of perspective in medieval art, in both the east and the west, for more than 600 years. many later european scholars and fellow polymaths, from robert grosseteste and leonardo da vinci to rené descartes, johannes kepler and isaac newton, were in his debt. indeed, the influence of ibn al-haytham\\'s optics ranks alongside that of newton\\'s work of the same title, published 700 years later.\\n\\nthe translation of the book of optics had a huge impact on europe. from it, later european scholars were able to build devices that replicated those ibn al-haytham had built and understand the way light works. from this, important inventions such as eyeglasses, magnifying glasses, telescopes, and cameras were developed.\\nclassical\\nmain article: classical physics\\ngalileo galilei (1564–1642) showed a modern appreciation for the proper relationship between mathematics, theoretical physics, and experimental physics.\\nsir isaac newton (1643–1727), whose laws of motion and universal gravitation were major milestones in classical physics\\n\\nphysics became a separate science when early modern europeans used experimental and quantitative methods to discover what are now considered to be the laws of physics.[28][page needed]\\n\\nmajor developments in this period include the replacement of the geocentric model of the solar system with the heliocentric copernican model, the laws governing the motion of planetary bodies (determined by kepler between 1609 and 1619), galileo\\'s pioneering work on telescopes and observational astronomy in the 16th and 17th centuries, and isaac newton\\'s discovery and unification of the laws of motion and universal gravitation (that would come to bear his name).[29] newton also developed calculus,[d] the mathematical study of continuous change, which provided new mathematical methods for solving physical problems.[30]\\n\\nthe discovery of new laws in thermodynamics, chemistry, and electromagnetics resulted from research efforts during the industrial revolution as energy needs increased.[31] the laws comprising classical physics remain very widely used for objects on everyday scales travelling at non-relativistic speeds, since they provide a very close approximation in such situations, and theories such as quantum mechanics and the theory of relativity simplify to their classical equivalents at such scales. inaccuracies in classical mechanics for very small objects and very high velocities led to the development of modern physics in the 20th century.\\nmodern\\nmain article: modern physics\\nsee also: history of special relativity and history of quantum mechanics\\nmax planck (1858–1947), the originator of the theory of quantum mechanics\\nalbert einstein (1879–1955), whose work on the photoelectric effect and the theory of relativity led to a revolution in 20th century physics\\n\\nmodern physics began in the early 20th century with the work of max planck in quantum theory and albert einstein\\'s theory of relativity. both of these theories came about due to inaccuracies in classical mechanics in certain situations. classical mechanics predicted that the speed of light depends on the motion of the observer, which could not be resolved with the constant speed predicted by maxwell\\'s equations of electromagnetism. this discrepancy was corrected by einstein\\'s theory of special relativity, which replaced classical mechanics for fast-moving bodies and allowed for a constant speed of light.[32] black-body radiation provided another problem for classical physics, which was corrected when planck proposed that the excitation of material oscillators is possible only in discrete steps proportional to their frequency. this, along with the photoelectric effect and a complete theory predicting discrete energy levels of electron orbitals, led to the theory of quantum mechanics improving on classical physics at very small scales.[33]\\n\\nquantum mechanics would come to be pioneered by werner heisenberg, erwin schrödinger and paul dirac.[33] from this early work, and work in related fields, the standard model of particle physics was derived.[34] following the discovery of a particle with properties consistent with the higgs boson at cern in 2012,[35] all fundamental particles predicted by the standard model, and no others, appear to exist; however, physics beyond the standard model, with theories such as supersymmetry, is an active area of research.[36] areas of mathematics in general are important to this field, such as the study of probabilities and groups.\\nphilosophy\\nmain article: philosophy of physics\\n\\nin many ways, physics stems from ancient greek philosophy. from thales\\' first attempt to characterize matter, to democritus\\' deduction that matter ought to reduce to an invariant state the ptolemaic astronomy of a crystalline firmament, and aristotle\\'s book physics (an early book on physics, which attempted to analyze and define motion from a philosophical point of view), various greek philosophers advanced their own theories of nature. physics was known as natural philosophy until the late 18th century.[e]\\n\\nby the 19th century, physics was realized as a discipline distinct from philosophy and the other sciences. physics, as with the rest of science, relies on philosophy of science and its \"scientific method\" to advance our knowledge of the physical world.[38] the scientific method employs a priori reasoning as well as a posteriori reasoning and the use of bayesian inference to measure the validity of a given theory.[39]\\n\\nthe development of physics has answered many questions of early philosophers but has also raised new questions. study of the philosophical issues surrounding physics, the philosophy of physics, involves issues such as the nature of space and time, determinism, and metaphysical outlooks such as empiricism, naturalism and realism.[40]\\n\\nmany physicists have written about the philosophical implications of their work, for instance laplace, who championed causal determinism,[41] and erwin schrödinger, who wrote on quantum mechanics.[42][43] the mathematical physicist roger penrose has been called a platonist by stephen hawking,[44] a view penrose discusses in his book, the road to reality.[45] hawking referred to himself as an \"unashamed reductionist\" and took issue with penrose\\'s views.[46]\\ncore theories\\nfurther information: branches of physics and outline of physics\\n\\nthough physics deals with a wide variety of systems, certain theories are used by all physicists. each of these theories was experimentally tested numerous times and found to be an adequate approximation of nature. for instance, the theory of classical mechanics accurately describes the motion of objects, provided they are much larger than atoms and moving at a speed much less than the speed of light. these theories continue to be areas of active research today. chaos theory, a remarkable aspect of classical mechanics, was discovered in the 20th century, three centuries after the original formulation of classical mechanics by newton (1642–1727).\\n\\nthese central theories are important tools for research into more specialized topics, and any physicist, regardless of their specialization, is expected to be literate in them. these include classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, electromagnetism, and special relativity.\\nclassical\\nmain article: classical physics\\n\\nclassical physics includes the traditional branches and topics that were recognized and well-developed before the beginning of the 20th century—classical mechanics, acoustics, optics, thermodynamics, and electromagnetism. classical mechanics is concerned with bodies acted on by forces and bodies in motion and may be divided into statics (study of the forces on a body or bodies not subject to an acceleration), kinematics (study of motion without regard to its causes), and dynamics (study of motion and the forces that affect it); mechanics may also be divided into solid mechanics and fluid mechanics (known together as continuum mechanics), the latter include such branches as hydrostatics, hydrodynamics, aerodynamics, and pneumatics. acoustics is the study of how sound is produced, controlled, transmitted and received.[47] important modern branches of acoustics include ultrasonics, the study of sound waves of very high frequency beyond the range of human hearing; bioacoustics, the physics of animal calls and hearing,[48] and electroacoustics, the manipulation of audible sound waves using electronics.[49]\\n\\noptics, the study of light, is concerned not only with visible light but also with infrared and ultraviolet radiation, which exhibit all of the phenomena of visible light except visibility, e.g., reflection, refraction, interference, diffraction, dispersion, and polarization of light. heat is a form of energy, the internal energy possessed by the particles of which a substance is composed; thermodynamics deals with the relationships between heat and other forms of energy. electricity and magnetism have been studied as a single branch of physics since the intimate connection between them was discovered in the early 19th century; an electric current gives rise to a magnetic field, and a changing magnetic field induces an electric current. electrostatics deals with electric charges at rest, electrodynamics with moving charges, and magnetostatics with magnetic poles at rest.\\nmodern\\nmain article: modern physics\\nmodern physics\\nh ^ | ψ n ( t ) ⟩ = i ℏ ∂ ∂ t | ψ n ( t ) ⟩ {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\hat {h}}|\\\\psi _{n}(t)\\\\rangle =i\\\\hbar

scale of observation, while much of modern physics is concerned with the behavior of matter and energy under extreme conditions or on a very large or very small scale. for example, atomic and nuclear physics study matter on the smallest scale at which chemical elements can be identified. the physics of elementary particles is on an even smaller scale since it is concerned with the most basic units of matter; this branch of physics is also known as high-energy physics because of the extremely high energies necessary to produce many types of particles in particle accelerators. on this scale, ordinary, commonsensical notions of space, time, matter, and energy are no longer valid.[50]\\n\\nthe two chief theories of modern physics present a different picture of the concepts of space, time, and matter from that presented by classical physics. classical mechanics approximates nature as continuous, while quantum theory is concerned with the discrete nature of many phenomena at the atomic and subatomic level and with the complementary aspects of particles and waves in the description of such phenomena. the theory of relativity is concerned with the description of phenomena that take place in a frame of reference that is in motion with respect to an observer; the special theory of relativity is concerned with motion in the absence of gravitational fields and the general theory of relativity with motion and its connection with gravitation. both quantum theory and the theory of relativity find applications in many areas of modern physics.[51]\\nfundamental concepts in modern

prominent physicists such as albert einstein, werner heisenberg, max planck, hendrik lorentz, niels bohr, marie curie, erwin schrödinger and paul dirac\\n\\nloosely speaking, the laws of classical physics accurately describe systems whose important length scales are greater than the atomic scale and whose motions are much slower than the speed of light. outside of this domain, observations do not match predictions provided by classical mechanics. einstein contributed the framework of special relativity, which replaced notions of absolute time and space with spacetime and allowed an accurate description of systems whose components have speeds approaching the speed of light. planck, schrödinger, and others introduced quantum mechanics, a probabilistic notion of particles and interactions that allowed an accurate description of atomic and subatomic scales. later, quantum field theory unified quantum mechanics and special relativity. general relativity allowed for a dynamical, curved spacetime, with which highly massive systems and the large-scale structure of the universe can be well-described. general relativity has not yet been unified with the other fundamental descriptions; several candidate theories of quantum gravity are being developed.\\nrelation to other fields\\nthis parabola-shaped lava flow illustrates the application of mathematics in physics—in this case, galileo\\'s law of falling bodies.\\nmathematics and ontology are used in physics. physics is used in chemistry and cosmology.\\nprerequisites\\n\\nmathematics provides a compact and exact language used to describe the order in nature. this was noted and advocated by pythagoras,[52] plato,[53] galileo,[54] and newton.\\n\\nphysics uses mathematics[55] to organise and formulate experimental results. from those results, precise or estimated solutions are obtained, or quantitative results, from which new predictions can be made and experimentally confirmed or negated. the results from physics experiments are numerical data, with their units of measure and estimates of the errors in the measurements. technologies based on mathematics, like computation have made computational physics an active area of research.\\nthe distinction between mathematics and physics is clear-cut, but not always obvious, especially in mathematical physics.\\n\\nontology is a prerequisite for physics, but not for mathematics. it means physics is ultimately concerned with descriptions of the real world, while mathematics is concerned with abstract patterns, even beyond the real world. thus physics statements are synthetic, while mathematical statements are analytic. mathematics contains hypotheses, while physics contains theories. mathematics statements have to be only logically true, while predictions of physics statements must match observed and experimental data.\\n\\nthe distinction is clear-cut, but not always obvious. for example, mathematical physics is the application of mathematics in physics. its methods are mathematical, but its subject is physical.[56] the problems in this field start with a \"mathematical model of a physical situation\" (system) and a \"mathematical description of a physical law\" that will be applied to that system. every mathematical statement used for solving has a hard-to-find physical meaning. the final mathematical solution has an easier-to-find meaning, because it is what the solver is looking for.[clarification needed]\\n\\npure physics is a branch of fundamental science (also called basic science). physics is also called \"the fundamental science\" because all branches of natural science like chemistry, astronomy, geology, and biology are constrained by laws of physics.[57] similarly, chemistry is often called the central science because of its role in linking the physical sciences. for example, chemistry studies properties, structures, and reactions of matter (chemistry\\'s focus on the molecular and atomic scale distinguishes it from physics). structures are formed because particles exert electrical forces on each other, properties include physical characteristics of given substances, and reactions are bound by laws of physics, like conservation of energy, mass, and charge. physics is applied in industries like engineering and medicine.\\napplication and influence\\nmain article: applied physics\\nclassical physics implemented in an acoustic engineering model of sound reflecting from an acoustic diffuser\\narchimedes\\' screw, a simple machine for lifting\\nexperiment using a laser\\n\\napplied physics is a general term for physics research, which is intended for a particular use. an applied physics curriculum usually contains a few classes in an applied discipline, like geology or electrical engineering. it usually differs from engineering in that an applied physicist may not be designing something in particular, but rather is using physics or conducting physics research with the aim of developing new technologies or solving a problem.\\n\\nthe approach is similar to that of applied mathematics. applied physicists use physics in scientific research. for instance, people working on accelerator physics might seek to build better particle detectors for research in theoretical physics.\\n\\nphysics is used heavily in engineering. for example, statics, a subfield of mechanics, is used in the building of bridges and other static structures. the understanding and use of acoustics results in sound control and better concert halls; similarly, the use of optics creates better optical devices. an understanding of physics makes for more realistic flight simulators, video games, and movies, and is often critical in forensic investigations.\\n\\nwith the standard consensus that the laws of physics are universal and do not change with time, physics can be used to study things that would ordinarily be mired in uncertainty. for example, in the study of the origin of the earth, one can reasonably model earth\\'s mass, temperature, and rate of rotation, as a function of time allowing one to extrapolate forward or backward in time and so predict future or prior events. it also allows for simulations in engineering that drastically speed up the development of a new technology.\\n\\nbut there is also considerable interdisciplinarity, so many other important fields are influenced by physics (e.g., the fields of econophysics and sociophysics).\\nresearch\\nscientific method\\n\\nphysicists use the scientific method to test the validity of a physical theory. by using a methodical approach to compare the implications of a theory with the conclusions drawn from its related experiments and observations, physicists are better able to test the validity of a theory in a logical, unbiased, and repeatable way. to that end, experiments are performed and observations are made in order to determine the validity or invalidity of the theory.[58]\\n\\na scientific law is a concise verbal or mathematical statement of a relation that expresses a fundamental principle of some theory, such as newton\\'s law of universal gravitation.[59]\\ntheory and experiment\\nmain articles: theoretical physics and experimental physics\\nthe astronaut and earth are both in free fall. (pictured: astronaut bruce mccandless.)\\nlightning is an electric current.\\n\\ntheorists seek to develop mathematical models that both agree with existing experiments and successfully predict future experimental results, while experimentalists devise and perform experiments to test theoretical predictions and explore new phenomena. although theory and experiment are developed separately, they strongly affect and depend upon each other. progress in physics frequently comes about when experimental results defy explanation by existing theories, prompting intense focus on applicable modelling, and when new theories generate experimentally testable predictions, which inspire the development of new experiments (and often related equipment).[60]\\n\\nphysicists who work at the interplay of theory and experiment are called phenomenologists, who study complex phenomena observed in experiment and work to relate them to a fundamental theory.[61]\\n\\ntheoretical physics has historically taken inspiration from philosophy; electromagnetism was unified this way.[f] beyond the known universe, the field of theoretical physics also deals with hypothetical issues,[g] such as parallel universes, a multiverse, and higher dimensions. theorists invoke these ideas in hopes of solving particular problems with existing theories; they then explore the consequences of these ideas and work toward making testable predictions.\\n\\nexperimental physics expands, and is expanded by, engineering and technology. experimental physicists who are involved in basic research design and perform experiments with equipment such as particle accelerators and lasers, whereas those involved in applied research often work in industry, developing technologies such as magnetic resonance imaging (mri) and transistors. feynman has noted that experimentalists may seek areas that have not been explored well by theorists.[62]\\nscope and aims\\nphysics involves modeling the natural world with theory, usually quantitative. here, the path of a particle is modeled with the mathematics of calculus to explain its behavior: the purview of the branch of physics known as mechanics.\\n\\nphysics covers a wide range of phenomena, from elementary particles (such as quarks, neutrinos, and electrons) to the largest superclusters of galaxies. included in these phenomena are the most basic objects composing all other things. therefore, physics is sometimes called the \"fundamental science\".[57] physics aims to describe the various phenomena that occur in nature in terms of simpler phenomena. thus, physics aims to both connect the things observable to humans to root causes, and then connect these causes together.\\n\\nfor example, the ancient chinese observed that certain rocks (lodestone and magnetite) were attracted to one another by an invisible force. this effect was later called magnetism, which was first rigorously studied in the 17th century. but even before the chinese discovered magnetism, the ancient greeks knew of other objects such as amber, that when rubbed with fur would cause a similar invisible attraction between the two.[63] this was also first studied rigorously in the 17th century and came to be called electricity. thus, physics had come to understand two observations of nature in terms of some root cause (electricity and magnetism). however, further work in the 19th century revealed that these two forces were just two different aspects of one force—electromagnetism. this process of \"unifying\" forces continues today, and electromagnetism and the weak nuclear force are now considered to be two aspects of the electroweak interaction. physics hopes to find an ultimate reason (theory of everything) for why nature is as it is (see section current research below for more information).[64]\\nresearch fields\\n\\ncontemporary research in physics can be broadly divided into nuclear and particle physics; condensed matter physics; atomic, molecular, and optical physics; astrophysics; and applied physics. some physics departments also support physics education research and physics outreach.[65]\\n\\nsince the 20th century, the individual fields of physics have become increasingly specialised, and today most physicists work in a single field for their entire careers. \"universalists\" such as einstein (1879–1955) and lev landau (1908–1968), who worked in multiple fields of physics, are now very rare.[h]\\n\\nthe major fields of physics, along with their subfields and the theories and concepts they employ, are shown in the following

possible appearance of the higgs boson.\\n\\nparticle physics is the study of the elementary constituents of matter and energy and the interactions between them.[66] in addition, particle physicists design and develop the high-energy accelerators,[67] detectors,[68] and computer programs[69] necessary for this research. the field is also called \"high-energy physics\" because many elementary particles do not occur naturally but are created only during high-energy collisions of other particles.[70]\\n\\ncurrently, the interactions of elementary particles and fields are described by the standard model.[71] the model accounts for the 12 known particles of matter (quarks and leptons) that interact via the strong, weak, and electromagnetic fundamental forces.[71] dynamics are described in terms of matter particles exchanging gauge bosons (gluons, w and z bosons, and photons, respectively).[72] the standard model also predicts a particle known as the higgs boson.[71] in july 2012 cern, the european laboratory for particle physics, announced the detection of a particle consistent with the higgs boson,[73] an integral part of the higgs mechanism.\\n\\nnuclear physics is the field of physics that studies the constituents and interactions of atomic nuclei. the most commonly known applications of nuclear physics are nuclear power generation and nuclear weapons technology, but the research has provided application in many fields, including those in nuclear medicine and magnetic resonance imaging, ion implantation in materials engineering, and radiocarbon dating in geology and archaeology.\\natomic, molecular, and optical\\nmain article: atomic, molecular, and optical physics\\n\\natomic, molecular, and optical physics (amo) is the study of matter–matter and light–matter interactions on the scale of single atoms and molecules. the three areas are grouped together because of their interrelationships, the similarity of methods used, and the commonality of their relevant energy scales. all three areas include both classical, semi-classical and quantum treatments; they can treat their subject from a microscopic view (in contrast to a macroscopic view).\\n\\natomic physics studies the electron shells of atoms. current research focuses on activities in quantum control, cooling and trapping of atoms and ions,[74][75][76] low-temperature collision dynamics and the effects of electron correlation on structure and dynamics. atomic physics is influenced by the nucleus (see hyperfine splitting), but intra-nuclear phenomena such as fission and fusion are considered part of nuclear physics.\\n\\nmolecular physics focuses on multi-atomic structures and their internal and external interactions with matter and light. optical physics is distinct from optics in that it tends to focus not on the control of classical light fields by macroscopic objects but on the fundamental properties of optical fields and their interactions with matter in the microscopic realm.\\ncondensed matter\\nmain article: condensed matter physics\\nvelocity-distribution data of a gas of rubidium atoms, confirming the discovery of a new phase of matter, the bose–einstein condensate\\n\\ncondensed matter physics is the field of physics that deals with the macroscopic physical properties of matter.[77][78] in particular, it is concerned with the \"condensed\" phases that appear whenever the number of particles in a system is extremely large and the interactions between them are strong.[79]\\n\\nthe most familiar examples of condensed phases are solids and liquids, which arise from the bonding by way of the electromagnetic force between atoms.[80] more exotic condensed phases include the superfluid[81] and the bose–einstein condensate[82] found in certain atomic systems at very low temperature, the superconducting phase exhibited by conduction electrons in certain materials,[83] and the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases of spins on atomic lattices.[84]\\n\\ncondensed matter physics is the largest field of contemporary physics. historically, condensed matter physics grew out of solid-state physics, which is now considered one of its main subfields.[85] the term condensed matter physics was apparently coined by philip anderson when he renamed his research group—previously solid-state theory—in 1967.[86] in 1978, the division of solid state physics of the american physical society was renamed as the division of condensed matter physics.[85] condensed matter physics has a large overlap with chemistry, materials science, nanotechnology and engineering.[79]\\nastrophysics\\nmain articles: astrophysics and physical cosmology\\nthe deepest visible-light image of the universe, the hubble ultra-deep field\\n\\nastrophysics and astronomy are the application of the theories and methods of physics to the study of stellar structure, stellar evolution, the origin of the solar system, and related problems of cosmology. because astrophysics is a broad subject, astrophysicists typically apply many disciplines of physics, including mechanics, electromagnetism, statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, relativity, nuclear and particle physics, and atomic and molecular physics.[87]\\n\\nthe discovery by karl jansky in 1931 that radio signals were emitted by celestial bodies initiated the science of radio astronomy. most recently, the frontiers of astronomy have been expanded by space exploration. perturbations and interference from the earth\\'s atmosphere make space-based observations necessary for infrared, ultraviolet, gamma-ray, and x-ray astronomy.\\n\\nphysical cosmology is the study of the formation and evolution of the universe on its largest scales. albert einstein\\'s theory of relativity plays a central role in all modern cosmological theories. in the early 20th century, hubble\\'s discovery that the universe is expanding, as shown by the hubble diagram, prompted rival explanations known as the steady state universe and the big bang.\\n\\nthe big bang was confirmed by the success of big bang nucleosynthesis and the discovery of the cosmic microwave background in 1964. the big bang model rests on two theoretical pillars: albert einstein\\'s general relativity and the cosmological principle. cosmologists have recently established the λcdm model of the evolution of the universe, which includes cosmic inflation, dark energy, and dark matter.\\n\\nnumerous possibilities and discoveries are anticipated to emerge from new data from the fermi gamma-ray space telescope over the upcoming decade and vastly revise or clarify existing models of the universe.[88][89] in particular, the potential for a tremendous discovery surrounding dark matter is possible over the next several years.[90] fermi will search for evidence that dark matter is composed of weakly interacting massive particles, complementing similar experiments with the large hadron collider and other underground detectors.\\n\\nibex is already yielding new astrophysical discoveries: \"no one knows what is creating the ena (energetic neutral atoms) ribbon\" along the termination shock of the solar wind, \"but everyone agrees that it means the textbook picture of the heliosphere—in which the solar system\\'s enveloping pocket filled with the solar wind\\'s charged particles is plowing through the onrushing \\'galactic wind\\' of the interstellar medium in the shape of a comet—is wrong.\"[91]\\ncurrent

of high-temperature superconductivity.[92] many condensed matter experiments are aiming to fabricate workable spintronics and quantum computers.[79][93]\\n\\nin particle physics, the first pieces of experimental evidence for physics beyond the standard model have begun to appear. foremost among these are indications that neutrinos have non-zero mass. these experimental results appear to have solved the long-standing solar neutrino problem, and the physics of massive neutrinos remains an area of active theoretical and experimental research. the large hadron collider has already found the higgs boson, but future research aims to prove or disprove the supersymmetry, which extends the standard model of particle physics. research on the nature of the major mysteries of dark matter and dark energy is also currently ongoing.[94]\\n\\nalthough much progress has been made in high-energy, quantum, and astronomical physics, many everyday phenomena involving complexity,[95] chaos,[96] or turbulence[97] are still poorly understood. complex problems that seem like they could be solved by a clever application of dynamics and mechanics remain unsolved; examples include the formation of sandpiles, nodes in trickling water, the shape of water droplets, mechanisms of surface tension catastrophes, and self-sorting in shaken heterogeneous collections.[i][98]\\n\\nthese complex phenomena have received growing attention since the 1970s for several reasons, including the availability of modern mathematical methods and computers, which enabled complex systems to be modeled in new ways. complex physics has become part of increasingly interdisciplinary research, as exemplified by the study of turbulence in aerodynamics and the observation of pattern formation in biological systems. in the 1932 annual review of fluid mechanics, horace lamb said:[99]\\n\\n    i am an old man now, and when i die and go to heaven there are two matters on which i hope for enlightenment. one is quantum electrodynamics, and the other is the turbulent motion of fluids. and about the former i am rather optimistic.\\n\\nsee also\\n\\n    iconphysics portal\\n\\n    list of important publications in

\"universe\" is defined as everything that physically exists: the entirety of space and time, all forms of matter, energy and momentum, and the physical laws and constants that govern them. however, the term \"universe\" may also be used in slightly different contextual senses, denoting concepts such as the cosmos or the philosophical world.\\nfrancis bacon\\'s 1620 novum organum was critical in the development of scientific method.[7]\\ncalculus was independently developed at around the same time by gottfried wilhelm leibniz; while leibniz was the first to publish his work and develop much of the notation used for calculus today, newton was the first to develop calculus and apply it to physical problems. see also leibniz–newton calculus controversy\\nnoll notes that some universities still use this title.[37]\\nsee, for example, the influence of kant and ritter on ørsted.\\nconcepts which are denoted hypothetical can change with time. for example, the atom of nineteenth-century physics was denigrated by some, including ernst mach\\'s critique of ludwig boltzmann\\'s formulation of statistical mechanics. by the end of world war ii, the atom was no longer deemed hypothetical.\\nyet, universalism is encouraged in the culture of physics. for example, the world wide web, which was innovated at cern by tim berners-lee, was created in service to the computer infrastructure of cern, and was/is intended for use by physicists worldwide. the same might be said for arxiv.org\\n\\n    see the work of ilya prigogine, on \\'systems far from equilibrium\\', and

with a broad scope but has several unifying themes that tie it together as a single, coherent field.[1][2][3] for instance, all organisms are made up of cells that process hereditary information encoded in genes, which can be transmitted to future generations. another major theme is evolution, which explains the unity and diversity of life.[1][2][3] energy processing is also important to life as it allows organisms to move, grow, and reproduce.[1][2][3] finally, all organisms are able to regulate their own internal environments.[1][2][3][4][5]\\n\\nbiologists are able to study life at multiple levels of organization,[1] from the molecular biology of a cell to the anatomy and physiology of plants and animals, and evolution of populations.[1][6] hence, there are multiple subdisciplines within biology, each defined by the nature of their research questions and the tools that they use.[7][8][9] like other scientists, biologists use the scientific method to make observations, pose questions, generate hypotheses, perform experiments, and form conclusions about the world around them.[1]\\n\\nlife on earth, which emerged more than 3.7 billion years ago,[10] is immensely diverse. biologists have sought to study and classify the various forms of life, from prokaryotic organisms such as archaea and bacteria to eukaryotic organisms such as protists, fungi, plants, and animals. these various organisms contribute to the biodiversity of an ecosystem, where they play specialized roles in the cycling of nutrients and energy through their biophysical environment.\\nhistory\\nmain article: history of biology\\na drawing of a fly from facing up, with wing detail\\ndiagram of a fly from robert hooke\\'s innovative micrographia, 1665.\\n\\nthe earliest of roots of science, which included medicine, can be traced to ancient egypt and mesopotamia in around 3000 to 1200 bce.[11][12] their contributions shaped ancient greek natural philosophy.[11][12][13][14] ancient greek philosophers such as aristotle (384–322 bce) contributed extensively to the development of biological knowledge. he explored biological causation and the diversity of life. his successor, theophrastus, began the scientific study of plants.[15] scholars of the medieval islamic world who wrote on biology included al-jahiz (781–869), al-dīnawarī (828–896), who wrote on botany,[16] and rhazes (865–925) who wrote on anatomy and physiology. medicine was especially well studied by islamic scholars working in greek philosopher traditions, while natural history drew heavily on aristotelian thought.\\n\\nbiology began to quickly develop with anton van leeuwenhoek\\'s dramatic improvement of the microscope. it was then that scholars discovered spermatozoa, bacteria, infusoria and the diversity of microscopic life. investigations by jan swammerdam led to new interest in entomology and helped to develop techniques of microscopic dissection and staining.[17] advances in microscopy had a profound impact on biological thinking. in the early 19th century, biologists pointed to the central importance of the cell. in 1838, schleiden and schwann began promoting the now universal ideas that (1) the basic unit of organisms is the cell and (2) that individual cells have all the characteristics of life, although they opposed the idea that (3) all cells come from the division of other cells, continuing to support spontaneous generation. however, robert remak and rudolf virchow were able to reify the third tenet, and by the 1860s most biologists accepted all three tenets which consolidated into cell theory.[18][19]\\n\\nmeanwhile, taxonomy and classification became the focus of natural historians. carl linnaeus published a basic taxonomy for the natural world in 1735, and in the 1750s introduced scientific names for all his species.[20] georges-louis leclerc, comte de buffon, treated species as artificial categories and living forms as malleable—even suggesting the possibility of common descent.[21]\\nin 1842, charles darwin penned his first sketch of on the origin of species.[22]\\n\\nserious evolutionary thinking originated with the works of jean-baptiste lamarck, who presented a coherent theory of evolution.[23] the british naturalist charles darwin, combining the biogeographical approach of humboldt, the uniformitarian geology of lyell, malthus\\'s writings on population growth, and his own morphological expertise and extensive natural observations, forged a more successful evolutionary theory based on natural selection; similar reasoning and evidence led alfred russel wallace to independently reach the same conclusions.[24][25]\\n\\nthe basis for modern genetics began with the work of gregor mendel in 1865.[26] this outlined the principles of biological inheritance.[27] however, the significance of his work was not realized until the early 20th century when evolution became a unified theory as the modern synthesis reconciled darwinian evolution with classical genetics.[28] in the 1940s and early 1950s, a series of experiments by alfred hershey and martha chase pointed to dna as the component of chromosomes that held the trait-carrying units that had become known as genes. a focus on new kinds of model organisms such as viruses and bacteria, along with the discovery of the double-helical structure of dna by james watson and francis crick in 1953, marked the transition to the era of molecular genetics. from the 1950s onwards, biology has been vastly extended in the molecular domain. the genetic code was cracked by har gobind khorana, robert w. holley and marshall warren nirenberg after dna was understood to contain codons. the human genome project was launched in 1990 to map the human genome.[29]\\nchemical basis\\natoms and molecules\\nfurther information: chemistry\\n\\nall organisms are made up of chemical elements;[30] oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen account for most (96%) of the mass of all organisms, with calcium, phosphorus, sulfur, sodium, chlorine, and magnesium constituting essentially all the remainder. different elements can combine to form compounds such as water, which is fundamental to life.[30] biochemistry is the study of chemical processes within and relating to living organisms. molecular biology is the branch of biology that seeks to understand the molecular basis of biological activity in and between cells, including molecular synthesis, modification, mechanisms, and interactions.\\nwater\\nmodel of hydrogen bonds (1) between molecules of water\\nsee also: planetary habitability, circumstellar habitable zone, and water distribution on earth\\n\\nlife arose from the earth\\'s first ocean, which formed some 3.8 billion years ago.[31] since then, water continues to be the most abundant molecule in every organism. water is important to life because it is an effective solvent, capable of dissolving solutes such as sodium and chloride ions or other small molecules to form an aqueous solution. once dissolved in water, these solutes are more likely to come in contact with one another and therefore take part in chemical reactions that sustain life.[31] in terms of its molecular structure, water is a small polar molecule with a bent shape formed by the polar covalent bonds of two hydrogen (h) atoms to one oxygen (o) atom (h2o).[31] because the o–h bonds are polar, the oxygen atom has a slight negative charge and the two hydrogen atoms have a slight positive charge.[31] this polar property of water allows it to attract other water molecules via hydrogen bonds, which makes water cohesive.[31] surface tension results from the cohesive force due to the attraction between molecules at the surface of the liquid.[31] water is also adhesive as it is able to adhere to the surface of any polar or charged non-water molecules.[31] water is denser as a liquid than it is as a solid (or ice).[31] this unique property of water allows ice to float above liquid water such as ponds, lakes, and oceans, thereby insulating the liquid below from the cold air above.[31] water has the capacity to absorb energy, giving it a higher specific heat capacity than other solvents such as ethanol.[31] thus, a large amount of energy is needed to break the hydrogen bonds between water molecules to convert liquid water into water vapor.[31] as a molecule, water is not completely stable as each water molecule continuously dissociates into hydrogen and hydroxyl ions before reforming into a water molecule again.[31] in pure water, the number of hydrogen ions balances (or equals) the number of hydroxyl ions, resulting in a ph that is neutral.\\norganic compounds\\nfurther information: organic chemistry\\norganic compounds such as glucose are vital to organisms.\\n\\norganic compounds are molecules that contain carbon bonded to another element such as hydrogen.[31] with the exception of water, nearly all the molecules that make up each organism contain carbon.[31][32] carbon can form covalent bonds with up to four other atoms, enabling it to form diverse, large, and complex molecules.[31][32] for example, a single carbon atom can form four single covalent bonds such as in methane, two double covalent bonds such as in carbon dioxide (co2), or a triple covalent bond such as in carbon monoxide (co). moreover, carbon can form very long chains of interconnecting carbon–carbon bonds such as octane or ring-like structures such as glucose.\\n\\nthe simplest form of an organic molecule is the hydrocarbon, which is a large family of organic compounds that are composed of hydrogen atoms bonded to a chain of carbon atoms. a hydrocarbon backbone can be substituted by other elements such as oxygen (o), hydrogen (h), phosphorus (p), and sulfur (s), which can change the chemical behavior of that compound.[31] groups of atoms that contain these elements (o-, h-, p-, and s-) and are bonded to a central carbon atom or skeleton are called functional groups.[31] there are six prominent functional groups that can be found in organisms: amino group, carboxyl group, carbonyl group, hydroxyl group, phosphate group, and sulfhydryl group.[31]\\n\\nin 1953, the miller-urey experiment showed that organic compounds could be synthesized abiotically within a closed system mimicking the conditions of early earth, thus suggesting that complex organic molecules could have arisen spontaneously in early earth (see abiogenesis).[33][31]\\nmacromolecules\\nmain article: macromolecule\\nthe (a) primary, (b) secondary, (c) tertiary, and (d) quaternary structures of a hemoglobin protein\\n\\nmacromolecules are large molecules made up of smaller subunits or monomers.[34] monomers include sugars, amino acids, and nucleotides.[35] carbohydrates include monomers and polymers of sugars.[36] lipids are the only class of macromolecules that are not made up of polymers. they include steroids, phospholipids, and fats,[35] largely nonpolar and hydrophobic (water-repelling) substances.[37] proteins are the most diverse of the macromolecules. they include enzymes, transport proteins, large signaling molecules, antibodies, and structural proteins. the basic unit (or monomer) of a protein is an amino acid.[34] twenty amino acids are used in proteins.[34] nucleic acids are polymers of nucleotides.[38] their function is to store, transmit, and express hereditary information.[35]\\ncells\\nmain article: cell (biology)\\n\\ncell theory states that cells are the fundamental units of life, that all living things are composed of one or more cells, and that all cells arise from preexisting cells through cell division.[39] most cells are very small, with diameters ranging from 1 to 100 micrometers and are therefore only visible under a light or electron microscope.[40] there are generally two types of cells: eukaryotic cells, which contain a nucleus, and prokaryotic cells, which do not. prokaryotes are single-celled organisms such as bacteria, whereas eukaryotes can be single-celled or multicellular. in multicellular organisms, every cell in the organism\\'s body is derived ultimately from a single cell in a fertilized egg.\\ncell structure\\nstructure of an animal cell depicting various organelles\\n\\nevery cell is enclosed within a cell membrane that separates its cytoplasm from the extracellular space.[41] a cell membrane consists of a lipid bilayer, including cholesterols that sit between phospholipids to maintain their fluidity at various temperatures. cell membranes are semipermeable, allowing small molecules such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water to pass through while restricting the movement of larger molecules and charged particles such as ions.[42] cell membranes also contains membrane proteins, including integral membrane proteins that go across the membrane serving as membrane transporters, and peripheral proteins that loosely attach to the outer side of the cell membrane, acting as enzymes shaping the cell.[43] cell membranes are involved in various cellular processes such as cell adhesion, storing electrical energy, and cell signalling and serve as the attachment surface for several extracellular structures such as a cell wall, glycocalyx, and cytoskeleton.\\nstructure of a plant cell\\n\\nwithin the cytoplasm of a cell, there are many biomolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids.[44] in addition to biomolecules, eukaryotic cells have specialized structures called organelles that have their own lipid bilayers or are spatially units.[45] these organelles include the cell nucleus, which contains most of the cell\\'s dna, or mitochondria, which generates adenosine triphosphate (atp) to power cellular processes. other organelles such as endoplasmic reticulum and golgi apparatus play a role in the synthesis and packaging of proteins, respectively. biomolecules such as proteins can be engulfed by lysosomes, another specialized organelle. plant cells have additional organelles that distinguish them from animal cells such as a cell wall that provides support for the plant cell, chloroplasts that harvest sunlight energy to produce sugar, and vacuoles that provide storage and structural support as well as being involved in reproduction and breakdown of plant seeds.[45] eukaryotic cells also have cytoskeleton that is made up of microtubules, intermediate filaments, and microfilaments, all of which provide support for the cell and are involved in the movement of the cell and its organelles.[45] in terms of their structural composition, the microtubules are made up of tubulin (e.g., α-tubulin and β-tubulin whereas intermediate filaments are made up of fibrous proteins.[45] microfilaments are made up of actin molecules that interact with other strands of proteins.[45]\\nmetabolism\\nfurther information: bioenergetics\\nexample of an enzyme-catalysed exothermic reaction\\n\\nall cells require energy to sustain cellular processes. metabolism is the set of chemical reactions in an organism. the three main purposes of metabolism are: the conversion of food to energy to run cellular processes; the conversion of food/fuel to monomer building blocks; and the elimination of metabolic wastes. these enzyme-catalyzed reactions allow organisms to grow and reproduce, maintain their structures, and respond to their environments. metabolic reactions may be categorized as catabolic—the breaking down of compounds (for example, the breaking down of glucose to pyruvate by cellular respiration); or anabolic—the building up (synthesis) of compounds (such as proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids). usually, catabolism releases energy, and anabolism consumes energy. the chemical reactions of metabolism are organized into metabolic pathways, in which one chemical is transformed through a series of steps into another chemical, each step being facilitated by a specific enzyme. enzymes are crucial to metabolism because they allow organisms to drive desirable reactions that require energy that will not occur by themselves, by coupling them to spontaneous reactions that release energy. enzymes act as catalysts—they allow a reaction to proceed more rapidly without being consumed by it—by reducing the amount of activation energy needed to convert reactants into products. enzymes also allow the regulation of the rate of a metabolic reaction, for example in response to changes in the cell\\'s environment or to signals from other cells.\\ncellular respiration\\nmain article: cellular respiration\\nrespiration in a eukaryotic cell\\n\\ncellular respiration is a set of metabolic reactions and processes that take place in cells to convert chemical energy from nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (atp), and then release waste products.[46] the reactions involved in respiration are catabolic reactions, which break large molecules into smaller ones, releasing energy. respiration is one of the key ways a cell releases chemical energy to fuel cellular activity. the overall reaction occurs in a series of biochemical steps, some of which are redox reactions. although cellular respiration is technically a combustion reaction, it clearly does not resemble one when it occurs in a cell because of the slow, controlled release of energy from the series of reactions.\\n\\nsugar in the form of glucose is the main nutrient used by animal and plant cells in respiration. cellular respiration involving oxygen is called aerobic respiration, which has four stages: glycolysis, citric acid cycle (or krebs cycle), electron transport chain, and oxidative phosphorylation.[47] glycolysis is a metabolic process that occurs in the cytoplasm whereby glucose is converted into two pyruvates, with two net molecules of atp being produced at the same time.[47] each pyruvate is then oxidized into acetyl-coa by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, which also generates nadh and carbon dioxide. acetyl-coa enters the citric acid cycle, which takes places inside the mitochondrial matrix. at the end of the cycle, the total yield from 1 glucose (or 2 pyruvates) is 6 nadh, 2 fadh2, and 2 atp molecules. finally, the next stage is oxidative phosphorylation, which in eukaryotes, occurs in the mitochondrial cristae. oxidative phosphorylation comprises the electron transport chain, which is a series of four protein complexes that transfer electrons from one complex to another, thereby releasing energy from nadh and fadh2 that is coupled to the pumping of protons (hydrogen ions) across the inner mitochondrial membrane (chemiosmosis), which generates a proton motive force.[47] energy from the proton motive force drives the enzyme atp synthase to synthesize more atps by phosphorylating adps. the transfer of electrons terminates with molecular oxygen being the final electron acceptor.\\n\\nif oxygen were not present, pyruvate would not be metabolized by cellular respiration but undergoes a process of fermentation. the pyruvate is not transported into the mitochondrion but remains in the cytoplasm, where it is converted to waste products that may be removed from the cell. this serves the purpose of oxidizing the electron carriers so that they can perform glycolysis again and removing the excess pyruvate. fermentation oxidizes nadh to nad+ so it can be re-used in glycolysis. in the absence of oxygen, fermentation prevents the buildup of nadh in the cytoplasm and provides nad+ for glycolysis. this waste product varies depending on the organism. in skeletal muscles, the waste product is lactic acid. this type of fermentation is called lactic acid fermentation. in strenuous exercise, when energy demands exceed energy supply, the respiratory chain cannot process all of the hydrogen atoms joined by nadh. during anaerobic glycolysis, nad+ regenerates when pairs of hydrogen combine with pyruvate to form lactate. lactate formation is catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase in a reversible reaction. lactate can also be used as an indirect precursor for liver glycogen. during recovery, when oxygen becomes available, nad+ attaches to hydrogen from lactate to form atp. in yeast, the waste products are ethanol and carbon dioxide. this type of fermentation is known as alcoholic or ethanol fermentation. the atp generated in this process is made by substrate-level phosphorylation, which does not require oxygen.\\nphotosynthesis\\nphotosynthesis changes sunlight into chemical energy, splits water to liberate o2, and fixes co2 into sugar.\\nmain article: photosynthesis\\n\\nphotosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy into chemical energy that can later be released to fuel the organism\\'s metabolic activities via cellular respiration. this chemical energy is stored in carbohydrate molecules, such as sugars, which are synthesized from carbon dioxide and water.[48][49][50] in most cases, oxygen is released as a waste product. most plants, algae, and cyanobacteria perform photosynthesis, which is largely responsible for producing and maintaining the oxygen content of the earth\\'s atmosphere, and supplies most of the energy necessary for life on earth.[51]\\n\\nphotosynthesis has four stages: light absorption, electron transport, atp synthesis, and carbon fixation.[47] light absorption is the initial step of photosynthesis whereby light energy is absorbed by chlorophyll pigments attached to proteins in the thylakoid membranes. the absorbed light energy is used to remove electrons from a donor (water) to a primary electron acceptor, a quinone designated as q. in the second stage, electrons move from the quinone primary electron acceptor through a series of electron carriers until they reach a final electron acceptor, which is usually the oxidized form of nadp+, which is reduced to nadph, a process that takes place in a protein complex called photosystem i (psi). the transport of electrons is coupled to the movement of protons (or hydrogen) from the stroma to the thylakoid membrane, which forms a ph gradient across the membrane as hydrogen becomes more concentrated in the lumen than in the stroma. this is analogous to the proton-motive force generated across the inner mitochondrial membrane in aerobic respiration.[47]\\n\\nduring the third stage of photosynthesis, the movement of protons down their concentration gradients from the thylakoid lumen to the stroma through the atp synthase is coupled to the synthesis of atp by that same atp synthase.[47] the nadph and atps generated by the light-dependent reactions in the second and third stages, respectively, provide the energy and electrons to drive the synthesis of glucose by fixing atmospheric carbon dioxide into existing organic carbon compounds, such as ribulose bisphosphate (rubp) in a sequence of light-independent (or dark) reactions called the calvin cycle.[52]\\ncell signaling\\nmain article: cell signaling\\n\\ncell signaling (or communication) is the ability of cells to receive, process, and transmit signals with its environment and with itself.[53][54] signals can be non-chemical such as light, electrical impulses, and heat, or chemical signals (or ligands) that interact with receptors, which can be found embedded in the cell membrane of another cell or located deep inside a cell.[55][54] there are generally four types of chemical signals: autocrine, paracrine, juxtacrine, and hormones.[55] in autocrine signaling, the ligand affects the same cell that releases it. tumor cells, for example, can reproduce uncontrollably because they release signals that initiate their own self-division. in paracrine signaling, the ligand diffuses to nearby cells and affects them. for example, brain cells called neurons release ligands called neurotransmitters that diffuse across a synaptic cleft to bind with a receptor on an adjacent cell such as another neuron or muscle cell. in juxtacrine signaling, there is direct contact between the signaling and responding cells. finally, hormones are ligands that travel through the circulatory systems of animals or vascular systems of plants to reach their target cells. once a ligand binds with a receptor, it can influence the behavior of another cell, depending on the type of receptor. for instance, neurotransmitters that bind with an inotropic receptor can alter the excitability of a target cell. other types of receptors include protein kinase receptors (e.g., receptor for the hormone insulin) and g protein-coupled receptors. activation of g protein-coupled receptors can initiate second messenger cascades. the process by which a chemical or physical signal is transmitted through a cell as a series of molecular events is called signal transduction\\ncell cycle\\nin meiosis, the chromosomes duplicate and the homologous chromosomes exchange genetic information during meiosis i. the daughter cells divide again in meiosis ii to form haploid gametes.\\nmain article: cell cycle\\n\\nthe cell cycle is a series of events that take place in a cell that cause it to divide into two daughter cells. these events include the duplication of its dna and some of its organelles, and the subsequent partitioning of its cytoplasm into two daughter cells in a process called cell division.[56] in eukaryotes (i.e., animal, plant, fungal, and protist cells), there are two distinct types of cell division: mitosis and meiosis.[57] mitosis is part of the cell cycle, in which replicated chromosomes are separated into two new nuclei. cell division gives rise to genetically identical cells in which the total number of chromosomes is maintained. in general, mitosis (division of the nucleus) is preceded by the s stage of interphase (during which the dna is replicated) and is often followed by telophase and cytokinesis; which divides the cytoplasm, organelles and cell membrane of one cell into two new cells containing roughly equal shares of these cellular components. the different stages of mitosis all together define the mitotic phase of an animal cell cycle—the division of the mother cell into two genetically identical daughter cells.[58] the cell cycle is a vital process by which a single-celled fertilized egg develops into a mature organism, as well as the process by which hair, skin, blood cells, and some internal organs are renewed. after cell division, each of the daughter cells begin the interphase of a new cycle. in contrast to mitosis, meiosis results in four haploid daughter cells by undergoing one round of dna replication followed by two divisions.[59] homologous chromosomes are separated in the first division (meiosis i), and sister chromatids are separated in the second division (meiosis ii). both of these cell division cycles are used in the process of sexual reproduction at some point in their life cycle. both are believed to be present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor.\\n\\nprokaryotes (i.e., archaea and bacteria) can also undergo cell division (or binary fission). unlike the processes of mitosis and meiosis in eukaryotes, binary fission takes in prokaryotes takes place without the formation of a spindle apparatus on the cell. before binary fission, dna in the bacterium is tightly coiled. after it has uncoiled and duplicated, it is pulled to the separate poles of the bacterium as it increases the size to prepare for splitting. growth of a new cell wall begins to separate the bacterium (triggered by ftsz polymerization and \"z-ring\" formation)[60] the new cell wall (septum) fully develops, resulting in the complete split of the bacterium. the new daughter cells have tightly coiled dna rods, ribosomes, and plasmids.\\ngenetics\\ninheritance\\nmain article: classical genetics\\npunnett square depicting a cross between two pea plants heterozygous for purple (b) and white (b) blossoms\\n\\ngenetics is the scientific study of inheritance.[61][62][63] mendelian inheritance, specifically, is the process by which genes and traits are passed on from parents to offspring.[27] it has several principles. the first is that genetic characteristics, alleles, are discrete and have alternate forms (e.g., purple vs. white or tall vs. dwarf), each inherited from one of two parents. based on the law of dominance and uniformity, which states that some alleles are dominant while others are recessive; an organism with at least one dominant allele will display the phenotype of that dominant allele.[64] during gamete formation, the alleles for each gene segregate, so that each gamete carries only one allele for each gene. heterozygotic individuals produce gametes with an equal frequency of two alleles. finally, the law of independent assortment, states that genes of different traits can segregate independently during the formation of gametes, i.e., genes are unlinked. an exception to this rule would include traits that are sex-linked. test crosses can be performed to experimentally determine the underlying genotype of an organism with a dominant phenotype.[65] a punnett square can be used to predict the results of a test cross. the chromosome theory of inheritance, which states that genes are found on chromosomes, was supported by thomas morgans\\'s experiments with fruit flies, which established the sex linkage between eye color and sex in these insects.[66]\\ngenes and dna\\nbases lie between two spiraling dna strands.\\nfurther information: gene and dna\\n\\na gene is a unit of heredity that corresponds to a region of deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) that carries genetic information that controls form or function of an organism. dna is composed of two polynucleotide chains that coil around each other to form a double helix.[67] it is found as linear chromosomes in eukaryotes, and circular chromosomes in prokaryotes. the set of chromosomes in a cell is collectively known as its genome. in eukaryotes, dna is mainly in the cell nucleus.[68] in prokaryotes, the dna is held within the nucleoid.[69] the genetic information is held within genes, and the complete assemblage in an organism is called its genotype.[70] dna replication is a semiconservative process whereby each strand serves as a template for a new strand of dna.[67] mutations are heritable changes in dna.[67] they can arise spontaneously as a result of replication errors that were not corrected by proofreading or can be induced by an environmental mutagen such as a chemical (e.g., nitrous acid, benzopyrene) or radiation (e.g., x-ray, gamma ray, ultraviolet radiation, particles emitted by unstable isotopes).[67] mutations can lead to phenotypic effects such as loss-of-function, gain-of-function, and conditional mutations.[67] some mutations are beneficial, as they are a source of genetic variation for evolution.[67] others are harmful if they were to result in a loss of function of genes needed for survival.[67] mutagens such as carcinogens are typically avoided as a matter of public health policy goals.[67]\\ngene expression\\nthe extended central dogma of molecular biology includes all the processes involved in the flow of genetic information.\\nmain article: gene expression\\n\\ngene expression is the molecular process by which a genotype encoded in dna gives rise to an observable phenotype in the proteins of an organism\\'s body. this process is summarized by the central dogma of molecular biology, which was formulated by francis crick in 1958.[71][72][73] according to the central dogma, genetic information flows from dna to rna to protein. there are two gene expression processes: transcription (dna to rna) and translation (rna to protein).[74]\\ngene regulation\\nmain article: regulation of gene expression\\n\\nthe regulation of gene expression by environmental factors and during different stages of development can occur at each step of the process such as transcription, rna splicing, translation, and post-translational modification of a protein.[75] gene expression can be influenced by positive or negative regulation, depending on which of the two types of regulatory proteins called transcription factors bind to the dna sequence close to or at a promoter.[75] a cluster of genes that share the same promoter is called an operon, found mainly in prokaryotes and some lower eukaryotes (e.g., caenorhabditis elegans).[75][76] in positive regulation of gene expression, the activator is the transcription factor that stimulates transcription when it binds to the sequence near or at the promoter. negative regulation occurs when another transcription factor called a repressor binds to a dna sequence called an operator, which is part of an operon, to prevent transcription. repressors can be inhibited by compounds called inducers (e.g., allolactose), thereby allowing transcription to occur.[75] specific genes that can be activated by inducers are called inducible genes, in contrast to constitutive genes that are almost constantly active.[75] in contrast to both, structural genes encode proteins that are not involved in gene regulation.[75] in addition to regulatory events involving the promoter, gene expression can also be regulated by epigenetic changes to chromatin, which is a complex of dna and protein found in eukaryotic cells.[75]\\ngenes, development, and evolution\\nmain article: evolutionary developmental biology\\n\\ndevelopment is the process by which a multicellular organism (plant or animal) goes through a series of changes, starting from a single cell, and taking on various forms that are characteristic of its life cycle.[77] there are four key processes that underlie development: determination, differentiation, morphogenesis, and growth. determination sets the developmental fate of a cell, which becomes more restrictive during development. differentiation is the process by which specialized cells from less specialized cells such as stem cells.[78][79] stem cells are undifferentiated or partially differentiated cells that can differentiate into various types of cells and proliferate indefinitely to produce more of the same stem cell.[80] cellular differentiation dramatically changes a cell\\'s size, shape, membrane potential, metabolic activity, and responsiveness to signals, which are largely due to highly controlled modifications in gene expression and epigenetics. with a few exceptions, cellular differentiation almost never involves a change in the dna sequence itself.[81] thus, different cells can have very different physical characteristics despite having the same genome. morphogenesis, or the development of body form, is the result of spatial differences in gene expression.[77] a small fraction of the genes in an organism\\'s genome called the developmental-genetic toolkit control the development of that organism. these toolkit genes are highly conserved among phyla, meaning that they are ancient and very similar in widely separated groups of animals. differences in deployment of toolkit genes affect the body plan and the number, identity, and pattern of body parts. among the most important toolkit genes are the hox genes. hox genes determine where repeating parts, such as the many vertebrae of snakes, will grow in a developing embryo or larva.[82]\\nevolution\\nevolutionary processes\\nmain article: evolutionary biology\\nnatural selection for darker traits\\n\\nevolution is a central organizing concept in biology. it is the change in heritable characteristics of populations over successive generations.[83][84] in artificial selection, animals were selectively bred for specific traits. [85] given that traits are inherited, populations contain a varied mix of traits, and reproduction is able to increase any population, darwin argued that in the natural world, it was nature that played the role of humans in selecting for specific traits.[85] darwin inferred that individuals who possessed heritable traits better adapted to their environments are more likely to survive and produce more offspring than other individuals.[85] he further inferred that this would lead to the accumulation of favorable traits over successive generations, thereby increasing the match between the organisms and their environment.[86][87][88][85][89]\\nspeciation\\nmain article: speciation\\n\\na species is a group of organisms that mate with one another and speciation is the process by which one lineage splits into two lineages as a result of having evolved independently from each other.[90] for speciation to occur, there has to be reproductive isolation.[90] reproductive isolation can result from incompatibilities between genes as described by bateson–dobzhansky–muller model. reproductive isolation also tends to increase with genetic divergence. speciation can occur when there are physical barriers that divide an ancestral species, a process known as allopatric speciation.[90]\\nphylogeny\\nmain article: phylogenetics\\nphylogenetic tree showing the domains of bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes\\n\\n\\na phylogeny is an evolutionary history of a specific group of organisms or their genes.[91] it can be represented using a phylogenetic tree, a diagram showing lines of descent among organisms or their genes. each line drawn on the time axis of a tree represents a lineage of descendants of a particular species or population. when a lineage divides into two, it is represented as a fork or split on the phylogenetic tree.[91] phylogenetic trees are the basis for comparing and grouping different species.[91] different species that share a feature inherited from a common ancestor are described as having homologous features (or synapomorphy).[92][93][91] phylogeny provides the basis of biological classification.[91] this classification system is rank-based, with the highest rank being the domain followed by kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species.[91] all organisms can be classified as belonging to one of three domains: archaea (originally archaebacteria); bacteria (originally eubacteria), or eukarya (includes the protist, fungi, plant, and animal kingdoms).[94]\\nhistory of life\\nmain article: history of life\\n\\nthe history of life on earth traces how organisms have evolved from the earliest emergence of life to present day. earth formed about 4.5 billion years ago and all life on earth, both living and extinct, descended from a last universal common ancestor that lived about 3.5 billion years ago.[95][96] geologists have developed a geologic time scale that divides the history of the earth into major divisions, starting with four eons (hadean, archean, proterozoic, and phanerozoic), the first three of which are collectively known as the precambrian, which lasted approximately 4 billion years.[97] each eon can be divided into eras, with the phanerozoic eon that began 539 million years ago[98] being subdivided into paleozoic, mesozoic, and cenozoic eras.[97] these three eras together comprise eleven periods (cambrian, ordovician, silurian, devonian, carboniferous, permian, triassic, jurassic, cretaceous, tertiary, and quaternary).[97]\\n\\nthe similarities among all known present-day species indicate that they have diverged through the process of evolution from their common ancestor.[99] biologists regard the ubiquity of the genetic code as evidence of universal common descent for all bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes.[100][10][101][102] microbal mats of coexisting bacteria and archaea were the dominant form of life in the early archean epoch and many of the major steps in early evolution are thought to have taken place in this environment.[103] the earliest evidence of eukaryotes dates from 1.85 billion years ago,[104][105] and while they may have been present earlier, their diversification accelerated when they started using oxygen in their metabolism. later, around 1.7 billion years ago, multicellular organisms began to appear, with differentiated cells performing specialised functions.[106]\\n\\nalgae-like multicellular land plants are dated back even to about 1 billion years ago,[107] although evidence suggests that microorganisms formed the earliest terrestrial ecosystems, at least 2.7 billion years ago.[108] microorganisms are thought to have paved the way for the inception of land plants in the ordovician period. land plants were so successful that they are thought to have contributed to the late devonian extinction event.[109]\\n\\nediacara biota appear during the ediacaran period,[110] while vertebrates, along with most other modern phyla originated about 525 million years ago during the cambrian explosion.[111] during the permian period, synapsids, including the ancestors of mammals, dominated the land,[112] but most of this group became extinct in the permian–triassic extinction event 252 million years ago.[113] during the recovery from this catastrophe, archosaurs became the most abundant land vertebrates;[114] one archosaur group, the dinosaurs, dominated the jurassic and cretaceous periods.[115] after the cretaceous–paleogene extinction event 66 million years ago killed off the non-avian dinosaurs,[116] mammals increased rapidly in size and diversity.[117] such mass extinctions may have accelerated evolution by providing opportunities for new groups of organisms to diversify.[118]\\ndiversity\\nbacteria and archaea\\nfurther information: microbiology\\nbacteria – gemmatimonas aurantiaca (-=1 micrometer)\\n\\nbacteria are a type of cell that constitute a large domain of prokaryotic microorganisms. typically a few micrometers in length, bacteria have a number of shapes, ranging from spheres to rods and spirals. bacteria were among the first life forms to appear on earth, and are present in most of its habitats. bacteria inhabit soil, water, acidic hot springs, radioactive waste,[119] and the deep biosphere of the earth\\'s crust. bacteria also live in symbiotic and parasitic relationships with plants and animals. most bacteria have not been characterised, and only about 27 percent of the bacterial phyla have species that can be grown in the laboratory.[120]\\narchaea – halobacteria\\n\\narchaea constitute the other domain of prokaryotic cells and were initially classified as bacteria, receiving the name archaebacteria (in the archaebacteria kingdom), a term that has fallen out of use.[121] archaeal cells have unique properties separating them from the other two domains, bacteria and eukaryota. archaea are further divided into multiple recognized phyla. archaea and bacteria are generally similar in size and shape, although a few archaea have very different shapes, such as the flat and square cells of haloquadratum walsbyi.[122] despite this morphological similarity to bacteria, archaea possess genes and several metabolic pathways that are more closely related to those of eukaryotes, notably for the enzymes involved in transcription and translation. other aspects of archaeal biochemistry are unique, such as their reliance on ether lipids in their cell membranes,[123] including archaeols. archaea use more energy sources than eukaryotes: these range from organic compounds, such as sugars, to ammonia, metal ions or even hydrogen gas. salt-tolerant archaea (the haloarchaea) use sunlight as an energy source, and other species of archaea fix carbon, but unlike plants and cyanobacteria, no known species of archaea does both. archaea reproduce asexually by binary fission, fragmentation, or budding; unlike bacteria, no known species of archaea form endospores.\\n\\nthe first observed archaea were extremophiles, living in extreme environments, such as hot springs and salt lakes with no other organisms. improved molecular detection tools led to the discovery of archaea in almost every habitat, including soil, oceans, and marshlands. archaea are particularly numerous in the oceans, and the archaea in plankton may be one of the most abundant groups of organisms on the planet.\\n\\narchaea are a major part of earth\\'s life. they are part of the microbiota of all organisms. in the human microbiome, they are important in the gut, mouth, and on the skin.[124] their morphological, metabolic, and geographical diversity permits them to play multiple ecological roles: carbon fixation; nitrogen cycling; organic compound turnover; and maintaining microbial symbiotic and syntrophic communities, for example.[125]\\neukaryotes\\nmain article: eukaryote\\neuglena, a single-celled eukaryote that can both move and photosynthesize\\n\\neukaryotes are hypothesized to have split from archaea, which was followed by their endosymbioses with bacteria (or symbiogenesis) that gave rise to mitochondria and chloroplasts, both of which are now part of modern-day eukaryotic cells.[126] the major lineages of eukaryotes diversified in the precambrian about 1.5 billion years ago and can be classified into eight major clades: alveolates, excavates, stramenopiles, plants, rhizarians, amoebozoans, fungi, and animals.[126] five of these clades are collectively known as protists, which are mostly microscopic eukaryotic organisms that are not plants, fungi, or animals.[126] while it is likely that protists share a common ancestor (the last eukaryotic common ancestor),[127] protists by themselves do not constitute a separate clade as some protists may be more closely related to plants, fungi, or animals than they are to other protists. like groupings such as algae, invertebrates, or protozoans, the protist grouping is not a formal taxonomic group but is used for convenience.[126][128] most protists are unicellular; these are called microbial eukaryotes.[126]\\n\\nplants are mainly multicellular organisms, predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom plantae, which would exclude fungi and some algae. plant cells were derived by endosymbiosis of a cyanobacterium into an early eukaryote about one billion years ago, which gave rise to chloroplasts.[129] the first several clades that emerged following primary endosymbiosis were aquatic and most of the aquatic photosynthetic eukaryotic organisms are collectively described as algae, which is a term of convenience as not all algae are closely related.[129] algae comprise several distinct clades such as glaucophytes, which are microscopic freshwater algae that may have resembled in form to the early unicellular ancestor of plantae.[129] unlike glaucophytes, the other algal clades such as red and green algae are multicellular. green algae comprise three major clades: chlorophytes, coleochaetophytes, and stoneworts.[129]\\n\\nfungi are eukaryotes that digest foods outside their bodies,[130] secreting digestive enzymes that break down large food molecules before absorbing them through their cell membranes. many fungi are also saprobes, feeding on dead organic matter, making them important decomposers in ecological systems.[130]\\n\\nanimals are multicellular eukaryotes. with few exceptions, animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen, are able to move, can reproduce sexually, and grow from a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic development. over 1.5 million living animal species have been described—of which around 1 million are insects—but it has been estimated there are over 7 million animal species in total. they have complex interactions with each other and their environments, forming intricate food webs.[131]\\nviruses\\nmain article: virus\\nbacteriophages attached to a bacterial cell wall\\n\\nviruses are submicroscopic infectious agents that replicate inside the cells of organisms.[132] viruses infect all types of life forms, from animals and plants to microorganisms, including bacteria and archaea.[133][134] more than 6,000 virus species have been described in detail.[135] viruses are found in almost every ecosystem on earth and are the most numerous type of biological entity.[136][137]\\n\\nthe origins of viruses in the evolutionary history of life are unclear: some may have evolved from plasmids—pieces of dna that can move between cells—while others may have evolved from bacteria. in evolution, viruses are an important means of horizontal gene transfer, which increases genetic diversity in a way analogous to sexual reproduction.[138] because viruses possess some but not all characteristics of life, they have been described as \"organisms at the edge of life\",[139] and as self-replicators.[140]\\necology\\nmain article: ecology\\n\\necology is the study of the distribution and abundance of life, the interaction between organisms and their environment.[141]\\necosystems\\nmain article: ecosystem\\n\\nthe community of living (biotic) organisms in conjunction with the nonliving (abiotic) components (e.g., water, light, radiation, temperature, humidity, atmosphere, acidity, and soil) of their environment is called an ecosystem.[142][143][144] these biotic and abiotic components are linked together through nutrient cycles and energy flows.[145] energy from the sun enters the system through photosynthesis and is incorporated into plant tissue. by feeding on plants and on one another, animals move matter and energy through the system. they also influence the quantity of plant and microbial biomass present. by breaking down dead organic matter, decomposers release carbon back to the atmosphere and facilitate nutrient cycling by converting nutrients stored in dead biomass back to a form that can be readily used by plants and other microbes.[146]\\npopulations\\nmain article: population ecology\\nreaching carrying capacity through a logistic growth curve\\n\\na population is the group of organisms of the same species that occupies an area and reproduce from generation to generation.[147][148][149][150][151] population size can be estimated by multiplying population density by the area or volume. the carrying capacity of an environment is the maximum population size of a species that can be sustained by that specific environment, given the food, habitat, water, and other resources that are available.[152] the carrying capacity of a population can be affected by changing environmental conditions such as changes in the availability resources and the cost of maintaining them. in human populations, new technologies such as the green revolution have helped increase the earth\\'s carrying capacity for humans over time, which has stymied the attempted predictions of impending population decline, the most famous of which was by thomas malthus in the 18th century.[147]\\ncommunities\\nmain article: community (ecology)\\na (a) trophic pyramid and a (b) simplified food web. the trophic pyramid represents the biomass at each level.[153]\\n\\na community is a group of populations of species occupying the same geographical area at the same time. a biological interaction is the effect that a pair of organisms living together in a community have on each other. they can be either of the same species (intraspecific interactions), or of different species (interspecific interactions). these effects may be short-term, like pollination and predation, or long-term; both often strongly influence the evolution of the species involved. a long-term interaction is called a symbiosis. symbioses range from mutualism, beneficial to both partners, to competition, harmful to both partners.[154] every species participates as a consumer, resource, or both in consumer–resource interactions, which form the core of food chains or food webs.[155] there are different trophic levels within any food web, with the lowest level being the primary producers (or autotrophs) such as plants and algae that convert energy and inorganic material into organic compounds, which can then be used by the rest of the community.[51][156][157] at the next level are the heterotrophs, which are the species that obtain energy by breaking apart organic compounds from other organisms.[155] heterotrophs that consume plants are primary consumers (or herbivores) whereas heterotrophs that consume herbivores are secondary consumers (or carnivores). and those that eat secondary consumers are tertiary consumers and so on. omnivorous heterotrophs are able to consume at multiple levels. finally, there are decomposers that feed on the waste products or dead bodies of organisms.[155] on average, the total amount of energy incorporated into the biomass of a trophic level per unit of time is about one-tenth of the energy of the trophic level that it consumes. waste and dead material used by decomposers as well as heat lost from metabolism make up the other ninety percent of energy that is not consumed by the next trophic level.[158]\\nbiosphere\\nmain article: biosphere\\nfast carbon cycle showing the movement of carbon between land, atmosphere, and oceans in billions of tons per year. yellow numbers are natural fluxes, red are human contributions, white are stored carbon. effects of the slow carbon cycle, such as volcanic and tectonic activity, are not included.[159]\\n\\nin the global ecosystem or biosphere, matter exists as different interacting compartments, which can be biotic or abiotic as well as accessible or inaccessible, depending on their forms and locations.[160] for example, matter from terrestrial autotrophs are both biotic and accessible to other organisms whereas the matter in rocks and minerals are abiotic and inaccessible. a biogeochemical cycle is a pathway by which specific elements of matter are turned over or moved through the biotic (biosphere) and the abiotic (lithosphere, atmosphere, and hydrosphere) compartments of earth. there are biogeochemical cycles for nitrogen, carbon, and water.\\nconservation\\nmain article: conservation biology\\n\\nconservation biology is the study of the conservation of earth\\'s biodiversity with the aim of protecting species, their habitats, and ecosystems from excessive rates of extinction and the erosion of biotic interactions.[161][162][163] it is concerned with factors that influence the maintenance, loss, and restoration of biodiversity and the science of sustaining evolutionary processes that engender genetic, population, species, and ecosystem diversity.[164][165][166][167] the concern stems from estimates suggesting that up to 50% of all species on the planet will disappear within the next 50 years,[168] which has contributed to poverty, starvation, and will reset the course of evolution on this planet.[169][170] biodiversity affects the functioning of ecosystems, which provide a variety of services upon which people depend. conservation biologists research and educate on the trends of biodiversity loss, species extinctions, and the negative effect these are having on our capabilities to sustain the well-being of human society. organizations and citizens are responding to the current biodiversity crisis through conservation action plans that direct research, monitoring, and education programs that engage concerns at local through global scales.[171][164][165][166]\\nsee also\\n\\n    biology in fiction\\n    glossary of biology\\n    list of biological websites\\n    list of biologists\\n    list of biology
